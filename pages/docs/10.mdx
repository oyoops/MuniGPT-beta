### ARTICLE XVIII. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS

# Sec. 39-305. Industrial zoning districts.

The following shall constitute industrial zoning districts for the purposes of this code:

M-1 Limited Manufacturing and Industrial District

M-2 General Manufacturing and Industrial District

M-3 Intense Manufacturing and Industrial District

M-4 Heavy Industrial District

(Ord. No. 1999-24, § 2, 5-11-99; Ord. No. 2013-04, § 2, 2-12-13)

# Sec. 39-306. Purpose of districts.

(a) The M-1 Limited Manufacturing and Industrial District is intended for the manufacture of small articles and products not involving the use of any materials, processes or machinery which would pose a potential environmental or safety hazard for nearby commercial business districts or residential areas. M-1 districts are intended to act as a buffer between commercial business districts and heavier manufacturing and industrial districts or to provide for planned industrial parks located in close proximity to residential areas. All activities relating to permitted uses and the storage of products, equipment and materials is limited to location inside a building.

(b) The M-2 General Manufacturing and Industrial District is intended to meet the general industrial and manufacturing needs of the unincorporated areas, providing for uses which may require open air storage of equipment, materials and products. M-2 districts are not intended for locations in close proximity to residential areas, and are not intended to directly abut commercial business districts.

(c) The M-3 Intense Manufacturing and Industrial District and M-4 Heavy Industrial District are intended for the heaviest manufacturing and industrial uses, involving the use, handling, and storage of hazardous materials, or industrial uses which require a substantial amount of open air storage area. No property shall be rezoned to M-3 if it is within five hundred (500) feet of any residential area or within two hundred (200) feet of any commercial business district. M-3 and M-4 districts should be surrounded by M-2 and M-1 zoning districts.

(Ord. No. 1999-24, § 2, 5-11-99; Ord. No. 2013-04, § 2, 2-12-13)

# Sec. 39-307. General provisions.

(a) _Display of products for sale._ In M-1 districts, all products displayed for sale shall be located within a building. Outside display and storage areas shall be permitted in all other manufacturing and industrial districts, provided such areas are designated on the approved site plan and provided that at least one side of the display and storage area shall be contiguous to the principal building to which it is accessory. Stocking or loading of products, materials or equipment shall be done internally on the premises or through a single gate at a designated offstreet loading area.

(b) _Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures_. Dumpsters located on any property in a manufacturing and industrial zoning district shall comply with the following:

(1) Dumpsters, which are visible from any street or from contiguous property, shall be kept within opaque or translucent enclosures and shall be located at least five (5) feet inside any plot line, except that no dumpster or dumpster enclosure shall be located in a required setback area, unless a street or dedicated alley separates the industrial plot from any adjacent residential or commercial business zoned property.

(2) Dumpsters shall be maintained free of jagged or sharp edges or inside parts which could prevent the free discharge of their contents.

(3) Dumpsters shall be emptied by a licensed collector at intervals which will preclude overflow. Dumpsters and the area around the dumpster and dumpster enclosure shall not be used for disposal of furniture and major appliances and shall be maintained by the property owner free of overflowing refuse at all times. If a continuous problem of insufficient dumpster capacity is proven to exist, additional or larger capacity dumpsters and enclosures or increased frequency of pick-up shall be required in order to eliminate the overflow problem.

(4) All dumpster pads shall be at least two (2) feet larger than the dumpster on all sides. Wheel stops or posts shall be permanently affixed to the pad at least one (1) foot inside the perimeter of the pad to prevent the dumpster from striking the enclosure during collection.

(5) Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures shall be located in a position accessible for collection by the equipment of the collector.

(6) The dumpster enclosure shall be constructed so as to accommodate recycling bins, if over forty (40) gallons.

(7) The gates of the enclosure shall be constructed of a frame with opaque or translucent walls affixed thereto, and both frame and walls shall be of a material of sufficient strength to withstand normal use. Gates shall be attached to metal posts at least three (3) inches in diameter with at least two (2) hinges. Each gate shall have a wheel at the bottom to prevent sagging and shall have drop pins or rods to hold the gates in place in both open and closed positions.

(8) The base of the enclosure must be poured concrete, in accordance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code. The base shall extend three (3) feet beyond the front opening of the enclosure as an apron, and all concrete must be level with the adjacent surface.

(c) _Landscaping._ All buildings and uses shall provide landscaping in accordance with Article VIII, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity," of this chapter.

(d) _Offstreet parking._ All buildings and uses shall provide offstreet parking, loading areas and lighting in accordance with Article XII, "Offstreet Parking and Loading," of this Chapter.

(e) _Setbacks and buffers between industrial and residential or commercial districts._

(1) The minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, in any manufacturing and industrial zoning district shall be ten (10) feet from a street line, unless a greater setback is required in this article for a specific use or as follows. The setback shall be a landscape buffer as required by Article VIII of this Chapter.

(2) The minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, on a plot in an M-1 district, which is separated from a residentially-zoned plot or a commercial business zoned plot by a street, dedicated alley, canal, water area, railroad right-of-way or public open space, shall be fifteen (15) feet from any such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. The entire setback area shall be a landscape buffer as required by article VIII of this Chapter.

(3) The minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, on a plot in an M-2, M-3, or M-4 district, which is separated from a residentially-zoned plot or a commercial business zoned plot by a street, dedicated alley, canal, water area, railroad right-of-way, or public open space, shall be thirty (30) feet from any such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. The first fifteen (15) feet of the setback from the street, alley, canal, water area, railroad right-of-way, or public open space shall be a landscape buffer as required by Article VIII of this chapter.

(4) The minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, on a plot in an M-1 district, which is contiguous to any residentially-zoned plot or a commercial business zoned plot, shall be twenty-five (25) feet from such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. A landscape buffer as required by Article VIII, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity," shall be provided within the setback area, including a visual barrier in the form of a fence, wall, or hedge constructed or planted and maintained as provided in Subsection (8) below.

(5) The minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, or for the storage of any product, material, or equipment, or for any activity in M-2, M-3, and M-4 zoning districts, which is contiguous to a residentially-zoned plot, shall be one hundred (100) feet, or which is contiguous to a commercial business district, shall be twenty-five (25) feet. The first fifteen (15) feet of the setback from the plot line contiguous to the residential or commercial business-zoned plot shall be a landscape buffer in accordance with Article VIII. A visual barrier in the form of a fence, wall, or hedge constructed or planted within the setback area as provided in Subsection (8) below shall be located within the landscape buffer if the M-2, M-3, or M-4 zoned plot is contiguous to a residentially-zoned plot.

(6) No building or structure shall be erected or maintained within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersection of two (2) streets, nor within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of any driveway and street, except as permitted in subsection (8) following.

(7) The setbacks required by this section shall also apply to those unincorporated lands which abut a municipal jurisdiction. Such setbacks shall be applied in the same manner as if the municipal lands were unincorporated lands.

Hedges used as a required visual barrier shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height at time of planting and shall be of a species which will reach at least the maximum height of eight (8) feet within two (2) years after planting. Open-weave or chain-link type fences may only be used within a required buffer if appropriate landscape material, in accordance with Article VIII, is planted along such fence which, after planting, will obscure the fence and provide a translucent barrier within one year after planting. Within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersection of two (2) streets, or within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of a private accessway and a street, only chain-link or other such open fencing may be erected or maintained. The use of barbed wire, razor wire or electrified fencing contiguous to commercial business zoning districts or residentially-zoned plots shall be prohibited.

(f) _Signs._ All buildings and uses shall be subject to provisions in Article VI, "Signs," of this Chapter.

(g) _Storage yards._ Unless otherwise specified in this article, any permitted open air storage area in an industrial district, which is visible from a residentially-zoned plot, shall be screened from view from such residential plot by an opaque or translucent wall at least six (6) feet in height, located consistent with requirements of subsection (e)(8) above. Open air storage areas shall be delineated on an approved site plan.
