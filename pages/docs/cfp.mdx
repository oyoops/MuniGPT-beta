PREFACE

since the first edition of _Getting Started as a Finan-_

_cial Planner_ was published, much has changed in our

profession: Fee-based financial planning is on the rise.

Commissions are being commoditized. And there is

now a profusion of financial planning courses and

training programs. The profession continues to grow

rapidly. In fact, the U.S. Department of Labor expects

the number of individuals employed as personal finan-

cial planners “to grow faster than the average for all occupations
through the year 2012.” This is because “as the number and com-
plexity of investments rises, more individuals will look to financial
advisers to help manage their money.”
Advising the public on financial planning issues continues
to be one of the most profitable areas of personal consulting.
Financial planners need to keep their clients focused so they
will continue accumulating sufficient assets to accomplish
their personal goals. Americans desire to get ahead and will
need effective strategies to pass the approximately $6 trillion
of intergenerational wealth to succeeding generations. These
growth opportunities in the marketplace and continued federal
deregulation of the financial services industry gave me reasons
to update this book.
My experiences have shown that individuals aspiring to be
professional financial planners want what is best for their clients.
These forward-looking planners have migrated to a comprehen-
sive needs approach to help their clients achieve financial objec-
tives, rather than continuing to employ a purely transactional
approach, which has long been the dominant theme of tradi-
tional financial planners. Historically, the main goal of this latter
group has been selling “product” rather than establishing a long-
term relationship. I became determined to help new financial
planners evolve their view of the planning process by providing a
logical, easy-to-digest, and automatic system that can help them
provide comprehensive financial planning services. The result
was the development of a turnkey approach to personal financial
planning, which is the essence of this book.
I decided to blend my own experiences with those of very suc-
cessful and well-known financial planners, including prominent
members of the Financial Planning Association, the California
CPA Education Foundation, the American Institute of Certi-
fied Public Accountants, members of the governing board of
the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, and various
university colleagues. I asked my associates if they were to start
all over again, would they approach financial planning the same
way? What would they do differently? What have they learned to

```
become successful financial planners? Where do they see their
practice and the profession headed? What does the competition
look like? Most of all, what advice can they give financial planners
first entering the profession? All the responses pointed primar-
ily to one fundamental need—that entry-level financial planners
have a business plan to guide them on starting a business. This
action plan, they advised new financial planners, must include all
the important infrastructure decisions that need to be in place
before taking on the first client (as opposed to the trial-and-error
approach many planners tried when they entered the profession).
Much of this invaluable information was incorporated into this
book in order to provide the reader with a clear, detailed, and
practical approach to practicing personal financial planning
across the spectrum from entry to mastering the profession.
Getting Started as a Financial Planner is written for stockbrokers,
insurance agents, CPAs, attorneys, bankers, credit union reps,
trust officers, wealth managers, and others who want to graduate
from the transactional selling approach to the client management
approach, which requires true understanding of clients’ needs,
capabilities, and resources. The book provides financial service
professionals and non–financially trained individuals first entering
the field with a method to graduate from a transaction-oriented
business model to one involving a step-by-step process. This book
helps explain that by using a comprehensive “client first” approach,
planners can uncover more of what their clients are looking for,
thus putting themselves in a better position to prepare a competent
plan. This change in direction ends up providing clients with an
understanding of previously unrecognized concerns and therefore
with better service, ultimately making more money for both the
client and the planner. This introductory book provides the basics
that the narrow-based financial planner can use to create the infra-
structure of a broad-based financial planning service. I decided to
write this book to help make this transition successful for evolving
planning advisers.
Getting Started as a Financial Planner is organized in a logical
business-cycle approach. It tackles critical issues every new financial
planner needs to address, from how to set up a practice through

writing the business plan, marketing it, and managing clients.
The book begins by providing an overview of the profession.
Chapter 1 describes who is attracted to the field, identifies the
trends in the industry that will create business opportunities in the
next decade, and takes the reader through the origins of financial
planning to what it has become today. Chapter 2 provides the
reader with the “Ten Must-Do’s” for establishing the successful
business infrastructure, from selecting the right business legal
entity to finding a mentor and picking a specialty.
Once the business is formatted, the planner needs a proven
process that will facilitate a comprehensive financial planning
program. Chapter 3 describes such a process, called PIPRIM, a
client management system that will help planners approach client
consulting in a complete manner and create client loyalty to the
process of long-term investing to accomplish financial objectives.
Chapter 4 provides the reader with an overview of the many dis-
ciplines in financial planning and elaborates the concerns clients
will have in each area and strategies the planner can use to satisfy
these concerns. The chapter identifies the dilemmas clients will
most likely encounter, explains how the planner should interpret
client issues, and provides strategies for overcoming client blind
spots. Chapter 5 tells the planner how to comply with the many
stringent laws affecting financial services.
Chapter 6 takes the reader through all the appropriate steps
for developing a business plan and offers a thorough sample busi-
ness plan. It also discusses how to develop the needed business
infrastructure, including establishing a compensation model that
represents the planner’s practice philosophy. Chapter 7 turns to
marketing a financial planning practice and provides many useful
strategies to help the entrepreneur become recognized and well
known. Chapter 8 provides techniques and insights for maximizing
dealings with clients through effective planner-client communica-
tion strategies. Understanding clients’ wants and needs enables
the planner to design a strategy to make clients feel comfortable
and involved during this process, and enables the consultant to
provide the best type of service. Chapter 10 provides additional
resources that can be instrumental in establishing a practice and

gaining the expertise needed in a variety of subject areas. And a
new chapter in this second edition, Chapter 9, integrates the prin-
ciples discussed throughout the book by presenting three com-
mon client scenarios and applying the best methods to address
each of their specific concerns.
Implementing the tools and techniques discussed in the
book will guide the planner through all the stages of becoming
a better financial planner. Planners can assess where they are
now and where they need to be in order to satisfy their financial
objectives.

Evolution of the Profession

financial planning is a relatively new profession.

It represents the first broad-scope service profession to

emerge in recent years. Its development can be traced

back to late 1969, when a small group of financial ser-

vices professionals met at a hotel near Chicago’s O’Hare

Airport to discuss the inadequacy they saw in the state of

financial services at that time. They voiced their frustra-

```
tions and searched for ways to introduce a new degree of client
orientation and professionalism into a field that was neither well
known nor well defined.
As a result of this meeting, a trade association was formed in
1970 to give voice to the concerns of the new group. This asso-
ciation, initially called the International Association of Financial
Planners, later changed its name to the International Association
for Financial Planning (IAFP). The early mission of this organiza-
tion was to provide an open forum, bringing together people rep-
resenting a variety of specialized areas within financial services.
The integration of these approaches eventually led to the emer-
gence of financial planning as a profession in its own right.
To help educate this growing constituency, the IAFP created
the College for Financial Planning in 1971, which gave rise to the
Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation. The first graduat-
ing class in 1973 consisted of forty-two CFP licensees. A close-knit
bunch, the graduates displayed the professionalism indicated by
the new certification, and thirty-six members of this group decided
to form a new association specifically for holders of the CFP des-
ignation, which they named the Institute of Certified Financial
Planners (ICFP). In 1985, the administration of the CFP designa-
tion was transferred from the College to an independent body
that eventually changed its name to the Certified Financial Plan-
ner Board of Standards (CFP Board).
The planning pioneers who founded this profession led a
movement to provide clients with better and more targeted ser-
vice. They looked forward to the time when comprehensive finan-
cial planning would become an accepted and integrated means
for providing service and product delivery to consumers. In doing
so, they revolutionized their business, creating a new way for indi-
viduals to manage their personal finances. The pioneers’ approach
was to focus on the clients’ needs and objectives by putting their
clients’ interests first and foremost, above personal gain.
The efforts toward targeted client service led to the develop-
ment of two principal types of financial plans, segmented and
comprehensive. Segmented plans enable practitioners to review
one aspect of a client’s life, such as insurance, investments, or 
retirement. Comprehensive plans provide a more detailed and
complete approach by factoring in all of the financial concerns
affecting the client’s life, such as cash flow, education, insurance,
investments, income tax, retirement, and estate issues. (Detailed
coverage of these topics appears in Chapter 4.) These revolution-
ary changes in approach paved the way for a new profession:
financial planning.
The next step for these innovators was to educate the public
about their new service profession. They wanted to show the pub-
lic how they differed from their predecessors and why it would be
worthwhile to use their services.
Sellers of insurance and investment products at this time were
viewed by many consumers as aggressive, pushy salesmen only
concerned about maximizing their personal wealth. Skepticism
and mistrust were creating a wedge between these individuals
and their clients. Stockbrokers, insurance agents, and limited-
partnership salespeople were seen in an unfavorable light within
the financial services industry to a large extent because of the
financial products they were pushing. Limited-partnership oppor-
tunities in real estate, oil, and cable entered the investment scene,
some of which became a fiasco for participating holders when
the tax laws relating to these structures were overhauled in 1986.
Because many clients were losing money and the public was get-
ting angry, Washington began to focus on increased regulation of
professional investment activity.
To counteract negative perceptions, a number of financial ser-
vice professionals began pursuing a different way of helping their
clients. They strove expressly to adopt a logical and consistent for-
mat in providing good financial advice not just in one specialized
area but in every aspect of clients’ financial lives. Furthermore,
they wanted their clients to know that they were trained specialists
in their areas of practice.
```
```
The Trend toward Specialization
viewed as a whole, financial planning still has a close connec-
tion with stock brokerage and insurance. Close to 70 percent of
all CFP licensees also hold securities and/or insurance licenses.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Today’s planners are primarily midcareer people looking for a
change. They receive their training from any of the three-hundred-
plus registered educational program providers that offer the CFP
or similar financial planning programs. However, an increasing
number of college students now major or minor in personal
financial planning.
To pursue their business model of fee-based financial plan-
ning, planners increasingly have begun gaining the knowledge
necessary to operate in a specialty. Accordingly, growing numbers
of planners are obtaining certification as a Certified Financial
Planner, Personal Financial Specialist, or Chartered Financial
Consultant. These designations have increased in popularity and
have gained national prominence especially since the mid-1990s.
The goal of individuals practicing under these designations is
to adhere to the high standards that have been created in order
to protect the public. Of course, there are many other financial
planners as well who, although not holding such titles, still main-
tain extremely high standards. However, financial planning cer-
tification holders generally have found it easier to attract clients
because of their technical knowledge and the perception of many
clients that certified experts are probably more knowledgeable
and more professional than other practitioners. While obtain-
ing a specialty designation may not be viewed universally as a
prerequisite for success, anything a planner can do to gain the
competitive edge is likely to be worthwhile. Competition is grow-
ing quickly—whereas only 42 CFPs were licensed in 1973, by the
year 2004 that number had grown to 44,888.

WHO ARE TODAY’S FINANCIAL PLANNERS?
Financial planners have come from a variety of fields and hold
many licenses and designations. As noted previously, many today
are midcareer professionals who have retired from their first field,
have grown bored with it, or wanted to branch out into something
new that involves helping others. For example, many are CPAs with
twenty or more years of experience who have found that their cli-
ents specifically ask for such services; if they fail to provide financial
planning, they run the risk of losing clients to other CPAs who do.

Similarly, many representatives, brokers, and related employ-
ees at major brokerage firms and insurance companies find it
difficult to compete solely by selling products; financial planning
offers a more flexible and comprehensive approach to satisfying
their clients’ needs. Likewise, bankers more and more are finding
that they cannot effectively compete in the service marketplace
without taking an overall view of financial planning for their cli-
entele. The banks have finally recognized that financial planning
in its own right can be a very profitable revenue center.
So what does all this mean? For many financial service profes-
sionals, the days of pushing a product-centered transaction with
little or no concern for client needs and objectives are gone.
That approach is being replaced by the services offered by more
sophisticated and better-trained financial planners who want to
understand their clients in order to make the most appropriate
choices for them.
The table on the demographics of CFP practitioners on the
following page provides a breakdown of the industries in which
CFP licensees originally practiced and the other licenses and/or
designations they currently hold.
```
```
HOW WELL DO FINANCIAL PLANNERS GET PAID?
Firsthand knowledge and appreciation of the profession are the
best platform from which to accurately assess the financial incen-
tives of financial planning. Financial planners can tailor their
practice and income to lifestyle goals. In essence, because this is
a profession in which the practitioner designs a “product line,”
earnings potential is truly unlimited. Financial planners are fast-
moving entrepreneurs. Practice growth and earnings are limited
only by personal initiative, salesmanship, ability, and tenacity.
```
```
What Sources Generate Income
for Financial Planners?
```
```
in the past, planners were primarily paid by commission on cli-
ents’ portfolio growth. They believed that compensation should
reflect the economic value of the products they sold, which yielded
expanding value to their clients over time. However, in recent
years a shift has occurred in the relationship between planner
and client. Gradually and quietly a revolution began, shifting the
basis of compensation from higher-risk commissions to flat fees.
This trend grew from the belief that planners should and could
become more independent and objective if planning services
were associated with financial strategy rather than recommenda-
tions for specific financial products or companies.
Planners, striving to increase their professionalism, wanted to
demonstrate that client needs were paramount over agent sales.
Planners could still expect substantial income opportunity, but
now it was in a manner that would no longer link personal gain to
commercial products. The emerging professional planner sought
the neutral position held by other service professionals such as
CPAs and attorneys.
Many financial planners completed this about-face on com-
pensation in a relatively short time, giving up the appearance of
possible conflict of interest. More and more, planners have aban-
doned fixed commissions for hourly fees or project contracts.
This change in thinking has had multiple benefits. First, trained
planners feel less pressure to sell products or “ends” and can turn
their attention to “means.” Clients clearly have responded more
favorably to the purchase of a financial planning process than to
a recommendation to buy. The latter function was in fact already
available from the client’s stockbroker. Financial planners thus
have differentiated themselves from securities traders. Planners
have begun to thrive on their enhanced image as the adviser, not
the salesperson.
This change came as something of a shock for some practitioners
and as an easy transition for others. Some planners could not make
the complete transition and went to so-called fee-based financial
planning, which combines commissions and fees. The remainder
went cold turkey and became fee-only financial planners. (See
Chapter 6 for additional discussion of revenue generation.)
As financial planning continues to gain prominence as a pro-
fession, the future lies in fee-for-service compensation. Planners
are proving to be very much worth the investment, and conse-
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
quently more and more clients are willing to assume the risk of
fees for service as they do when they consult a doctor, attorney,
or CPA.
Financial planner compensation is subject to the same market
pressures as the pricing of other professional services. The more
unique (in range and quality) the service offered, the greater
the differentiation and the greater the compensation. Careful
competitive analysis, product development, and documentation
of client performance directly affect earning power and sustain-
ability. As in any business, value-added service affects pricing in
financial planning. Astute financial planners lessen their risk
of swings in competitive pressures and other factors such as
stock market volatility by blending compensation schemes.
The tables at left show how CFP licensees structure compen-
sation. As noted previously, the predominant model is now a
combination of fees and commissions: the former ensures steady
income flow, and the latter rewards planners for exceptional per-
formance on the client’s behalf. For additional information, see
Appendix B: Trends in Staffing and Compensation.
```
```
Emerging Market Opportunities
in Financial Planning
```
```
the road ahead in financial planning is leading to many
new opportunities previously unavailable to financial planners.
Practitioners focused on expanding their product portfolio and
customer base need to be aware of these opportunities and react
quickly to beat the competition.
The significant trends include the following:
◆ Increasing attractiveness of financial planning as a career
◆ Shifting demographics and corresponding wealth
◆ Increasing parity in two-income families
◆ A volatile American economy
◆ Online access to financial information
◆ Consumer need for financial planning services
◆ Increasing competition from full-service financial institutions
```
```
FINANCIAL PLANNING AS A NEW GROWTH INDUSTRY
According to various surveys, CFP licensees ranked the following
reasons for high career satisfaction:
◆ Positive impact on client quality of life
◆ Opportunity for entrepreneurship
◆ High interpersonal job content
◆ Application of technical tools to solve client problems
◆ Competitive nature of the business
◆ Unlimited income growth
◆ Challenge of new business development
◆ Low business risk
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
It is interesting to note that business risk (professional liability)
was the last concern of financial planners. Interviews with planners
conducted by the author on why they chose to enter the finan-
cial planning field overwhelmingly revealed a motivation to help
people. Planners want to see clients become financially informed
and prepared for the future. This humanitarian drive in many ways
rationalizes the financial return planners themselves enjoy.
The essence of a career in financial planning is a challenge—
a challenge to solve quality-of-life problems in an environment
limited only by the practitioner’s will and creativity.

SHIFTING DEMOGRAPHICS AND CORRESPONDING WEALTH
Financial planning is headed into a major transition, propelled
by changing demographics. The retirement of 40 million baby
boomers is imminent. This population has new views about retire-
ment. It is something to look forward to; it is a time to continue
intellectual challenge and growth; it is a time to enjoy.
A significant opportunity exists for this baby boom generation,
which stands to inherit some $6 trillion over the next decade.
Furthermore, from mid-1982 through the year 2000 the stock
market created record highs on a fairly consistent basis (exclud-
ing occasional market downturns). Then the market tumbled
from 2001 through 2003. It is now more imperative than ever to
be responsive to client demands, because it’s not a sure thing that
the market increases each year. More consumers than ever need
good, solid financial advice.
The definition of retirement continues to change. No longer
do people retire _from_ something, such as a job. Now they are retir-
ing _to_ something, actively pursuing the dreams and goals they
planned for during their working years. The next generation of
retirees will face the inevitable decline of government assistance
and shrinking retirement plans in the workplace. People will find
themselves forced to take on more responsibility for financial
security. Luckily, emerging service industry segments—in partic-
ular, information technology—will offer enormous opportunity
for many people but greater financial risk for those who miss the
information revolution. In the center is an enormous population
of middle-income Americans, who today are discovering economi-
cal investing online and through discount brokers.
Financial Planning magazine states that 250,000 people are
self-proclaimed financial planners. Yet only about 60,000, or
about 25 percent, have qualified for certification or formal recog-
nition as a financial planner. Clearly, this supply is not enough to
deal with the demand from baby boomers and young Americans
striving to save early for educational financing and retirement.
This situation of demand exceeding supply for financial services
will lead to much specialization in retirement planning.
```
```
INCREASING PARITY IN TWO-INCOME FAMILIES
Another important market opportunity is earnings parity in two-
income families. Women are not only entering the workforce at
a higher rate, but their income growth is closing the gap with
men’s salaries, and in particular that of their husbands. Higher
joint incomes will lead to greater disposable income, higher tax
liabilities with a demand for reducing taxes, and more latitude to
save. On the other hand, many two-income families will give in to
the desire to spend, leaving little for the future. Both scenarios
create candidates for the financial planner. As time continues to
be the most scarce and valuable resource to dual-income families
and to the busy single person of the twenty-first century, profes-
sional help with financial planning will become increasingly nec-
essary. Time saved by shifting the task of financial planning to a
professional is time available for personal interests, family, and
community.

THE VOLATILE AMERICAN ECONOMY
There are more millionaires per capita today than ever before.
Conversely, more people are declaring bankruptcy than ever
before. Why the conflicting signs? We are in the midst of a fast-
paced and volatile economy. Many “paper” millionaires have
money to burn. Other Americans, tempted by easy credit, are
more in debt than ever before. More discretionary cash is finding
its way into the equity markets with no sign of hesitation, since
annual returns in recent years have been significant and steady.
```

```

```
Interest rates have been near historic lows. Inflation is practi-
cally nonexistent. Money invested through 401(k) plans is at an all-
time high. However, with more baby boomers approaching retire-
ment, it is becoming more evident that these individuals who have
worked so hard may not have the retirement funds they thought
they would. Because of this, baby boomers are insecure about their
retirement dollars and may have to postpone their retirement date.
These people are going to need more help in planning for their
available discretionary funds. On the other hand, more people are
going to need help managing their cash flow and preventing debt
overflow. Planners will have unique opportunities catering to the
needs of both populations.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Easy access to useful information has also created significant
opportunities in financial planning. Myriad channels to financial
information via the Internet have reached the average investor
heretofore dependent on _The Wall Street Journal,_ tips from daily
financial columnists, or stockbroker recommendations. These
consumers may well bypass financial planners in the same way
they are dispensing with old-time brokers. More and more of these
independent, take-charge people simply do not have the time to
wait for a broker or news flash. Moreover, the Internet is there
when the investor needs it. Financial planners will need to learn
how to compete by joining the Internet revolution. Rather than
viewing it as a threat, astute financial planners will use the Internet
as _their_ source of information and as _their_ vehicle to reach new cus-
tomers. Also, a wealth of new software can greatly assist planners in
evaluating risk and return. Planners have a tremendous opportu-
nity to show their skills to a more sophisticated audience.

CONSUMER NEED FOR FINANCIAL CONTROL
Years ago people depended on their local banker to watch the
family nest egg. Today people want to control their health, their
politics, their privacy, and their money. At the same time, two of
the hardest things for people to do are to ration funds to accom-
plish certain objectives and to set plans to work toward others.
Declining dependence on government institutions and tradition-
al financial institutions, such as the community bank, has created
a great opportunity for the financial planner to fill the void.
Potential consumers of financial planning services have a broad
range of worries, prioritized below:
◆ Retirement funding
◆ Income tax exposure
◆ Investment and asset growth during the earning years
◆ Managing cash
◆ Anticipating future health care costs
◆ Outliving assets
◆ Estate planning
◆ Funding education
◆ Amount of personal debt
◆ Downsizing and job loss
```
```
These worries are not temporary or linear. They occur simulta-
neously and stretch across social and economic distinctions. For
example, funding for education and retirement requires special
planning to increase assets with minimal risk.
```
```
INCREASING COMPETITION FROM FULL-SERVICE
INSTITUTIONS
Consumer choices for financial planning are changing, too.
Growing competition may result in an increase or decrease in
independent financial planners. As stated previously, technology
has influenced practices by creating opportunity that did not even
exist just a few years ago. Consider accountants recently forced to
redefine their profession. With the advent of tax software available
for as little as $40 or bookkeeping software at $100, technology
has decreased the need for accountants keeping general ledgers
and doing taxes. The ongoing expense associated with bringing
in a bookkeeper, accountant, or CPA on a monthly basis has been
eliminated by programs performing complex calculations with a
few keystrokes. Complicating the business horizon for CPAs are
companies such as Vanguard that offer tax preparation software
on the Internet for free. This further diminishes the long-term
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
need for accountants. As a result, independent CPAs and larger
accounting firms have expanded into a broad range of high-margin
consulting areas to make up for erosion in traditional areas.
For their part, stockbrokers have been concerned about the
quick development of Internet trading. For as little as $7, a client
can conduct a stock trade over the Internet for which a full-service
brokerage may have charged $150 in the old days. Why would a
customer pay a broker several hundred dollars to execute a trade
when the same service is available from an online trading com-
pany for $20 or less per trade? Many full-service brokers, such as
Merrill Lynch, have radically altered the way they do business by
entering the online trading market. Clients may choose to pay an
annual retainer to access a brokerage firm’s information products.
But why would investors pay that much more money to do what
they can do themselves with the same quality research? Few are
willing, and many are self-educated. Technology has completely
revolutionized the business. What will become of full-service bro-
kers who do not refine their business model for consumers in this
century? Seen any dinosaurs lately?
Not everyone will turn to the Internet or other new technolo-
gies to avoid traditional channels of financial services. There will
always be many high-net-worth individuals and people without
time or inclination who want personalized brokerage services. But
again, as the changing demographics illustrated above, older indi-
viduals and younger people are not afraid to use the computer to
find quality financial planning guidance. Financial planners need
to find ways to link themselves to online financial information.
Insurance brokers have seen their world turn flat as life insur-
ance sales stagnated over the past decade. Life insurance com-
panies are turning to other products, including mutual funds,
variable annuities, and financial planning as a way to make up for
the insurance revenue drain. With the repeal of the Glass-Steagall
Act, which prohibited insurance companies, investment compa-
nies, and banks from owning one another, many of these firms
have begun to offer full-service financial products to create one-
stop financial shopping. However, the small boutique financial
planning firms and solo practitioners who establish their market
niches and are technically good at what they do will always find a
home catering to the needs of their niche markets.
Financial planners will also come from professions outside the
world of finance. Engineers, architects, contractors, salespeople,
and other professionals are finding a new career enticing. Some
have achieved financial independence and are now motivated to
build the skills to help others with what they have accomplished
for themselves.
```
```
Issues Consumers Consider
When Selecting Financial Planners
```
```
given that market opportunities argue the need for profes-
sional financial planning services, the next logical consideration
is “How should consumers select a financial planner?” The con-
sumer will want to consider the following issues:
◆Do I need a specialist? This is the same question a patient
addresses in selecting a general practitioner or a medical spe-
cialist. The general financial planner provides a broad spectrum
of services. The specialist provides deep expertise in a specific
area. Consumers need to determine where their needs lie, now
and in the future.
◆ Is the planner affiliated with any financial product companies?
Affiliation with a financial firm can bias a planner’s answers and/
or recommendations to clients. On the other hand, affiliated
planners may be better informed on specific financial product
options offered to consumers.
◆ Does the planner earn significant commissions? A high ratio
of commission to total service revenue can be a warning that the
financial planner is biased. Consumer confidence is likely to be
higher with the more balanced fee-based (i.e., fee plus commis-
sion) service provider.
◆ Will the planner provide professional references? Consumers
want and expect to hear success stories, especially when they are
recent and relevant. Consumers will ask for references, and the
astute professional financial planner will view this as an opportu-
nity to shine, not as an inconvenience.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ Can the planner answer technical questions? Consumers of
financial services want confidence. Confidence is built when a
financial planner has earned or can demonstrate technical depth
with language targeted to the consumer. Consumers are wary of
too much jargon or too little technical depth.
◆ What does the planner charge? Potential clients are looking for
specific statements of charges for services linked to performance
outcomes. A fee structure based on the financial planner’s deliv-
ering specified products eases the consumer’s mind and makes a
commission arrangement more acceptable.
◆ What is the planner’s education and experience? In today’s
market consumers expect an adviser to have formal training and
accreditation or certification. The greater the financial risk taken
on by the consumer and planner, the more important the creden-
tials become. Successful planners may create consumer literature
to help prospective clients make the right choices, illustrating
their expertise and displaying their credentials at the same time.

in the past, most consumers have failed to recognize the need
for professional financial counseling. Many people who recognize
the need have failed to act or have made regrettable decisions
about financial guidance. When economic times are good, many
people have greater discretionary income, and few worry about
tomorrow. This exaggerated confidence in the future leads to
procrastination. Financial planners need to recognize that peo-
ple often spend more time planning their vacations than they do
planning for financial security. Today’s financial planner needs to
be a master at motivating people to take the right actions for the
right reasons right now.


in any new venture there is a strong impulse just to

get started. While energy and urgency are fundamental

to success in all competitive services industries, goal set-

ting and practice planning are the first considerations

for an aspiring financial planner. As with any new busi-

ness, one must have a clear vision of what one wants to

accomplish: what is the goal? The goal must be so fun-

damental and clear that it can be described in one to

CAREER

##### CHAPTER 2

```
three sentences. This high-level concept is the “big picture”
or mission that every business needs, whether new or well
established.
The goal is not day-by-day results but rather how a professional
financial planning practice will look five, ten, or even twenty years
in the future. The ultimate description of the practice will address
range of services, number of clients, type of clients, range of client
outcomes, geographical coverage, revenue, profitability, organiza-
tion size, and exit strategy. These issues and others that naturally
come to mind in the process of forward thinking will help in for-
mulating the goal.
This initial step—setting down your vision of what you want to
accomplish—is by far the most important and possibly most dif-
ficult task you will encounter on the road to a career in financial
planning. If the goal is wrong, all subsequent effort will be wrong.
Write the goal, and share it with friends and family. Let it sit and
incubate for a week. If it is still thinkable, achievable, and excit-
ing, then it is ready for work.
A good idea for a service business becomes a great idea if a
step-by-step implementation plan is crafted. What are the steps
necessary to create a new business that will still be on the right
track ten or twenty years down the road? Unfortunately, many
financial planners have good ideas but fail in their execution.
They either never really know what business they want to focus
on or they do not fully consider how to differentiate their prac-
tice. When a planner’s _personal_ needs are synchronized with _client_
needs in a well-thought-out practice start-up plan, success is much
more likely.
The popular saying “If you build it, they will come” holds true
for financial planning. The challenge is how to build it so that it
will thrive and endure. This process has two dimensions: (1) the
specific issues the planner needs to consider in planning a finan-
cial planning practice; and (2) the sequence of issues—deciding
what is addressed first.
The planner must carefully design an infrastructure that will
support a growing venture. Financial planning is a _service_ busi-
ness. A service, by definition, consists of intangibles—informal
advice, good client relations, and word-of-mouth marketing—and
tangibles—formal products, ancillary service alliances with com-
plementary professionals, and value-added financial information
tools. Perhaps most important, a service is making clients feel
confident that they are being cared for. When these services
are performed well at a fair price, clients will stay happy—and
enthusiastically recommend their planner to others. This chapter
introduces the beginning financial planner to the issues and steps
needed to build a service infrastructure.
```
```
“Ten Must-Do’s” for Developing
a Financial Planning Practice
```
```
ten key steps or “must-do” practice planning activities are
necessary to get the new business launched. Each practice plan-
ning must-do is briefly described below in the sequence in which
it should be considered. This chapter addresses several of the
practice start-up issues in some detail, and subsequent chapters
elaborate on the remaining topics.
1 Select a practice structure. Financial planning practices can
be structured as sole proprietorships, general partnerships, S cor-
porations, C corporations, or limited liability companies. Each
structural option has a unique character, set of benefits, and legal
limitations. This chapter reviews the differences among structural
options and shows how to assess the merits of each, relative to a
planner’s goals and needs.
2 Prepare a business plan. All new and established businesses
need some sort of written business plan. A good business plan
starts with the business environment, that is, the market, com-
petition, opportunities, and challenges. The plan describes the
objectives, strategies, and specific actions the person or company
will follow over time to master the business environment. A good
business plan carefully estimates the resources and contingencies
necessary to achieve objectives. Where is the business today, where
is it heading, and how will it succeed are questions answered in
a polished business plan. For a more detailed discussion, see
Chapter 6, “Building the Practice Infrastructure.”

3 Find a mentor. There is absolutely no substitute for experience.
The speed with which new financial planners establish their prod-
uct portfolio and client following is inversely proportional to the
number of mistakes they make along the way. The best proven
method to keep practice start-up snafus to a minimum is to find a
mentor. To expedite your entry into the marketplace, you should
team up with somebody who has been in the business for a while.
Get under a mentor’s wing, and you can learn from his or her
experience and profit from firm guidance in the right direction.
You can find mentor candidates speaking at financial planning
society meetings, running seminars at local educational institu-
tions, or through professional forums on the Web. Professional
society gatherings and publications normally feature programs
that place entry-level practitioners with mentors. Mentorships
are often an integral part of the financial planning curriculum
offered by graduate learning institutions. Check the business cur-
ricula offered by colleges in your area.
4 Get the credentials. Financial planning is technical. There is a
large body of information a financial planner needs to master in
the process of getting started _and_ even more for staying current.
Practitioners need to understand macroeconomic principles,
financial markets, basic and advanced asset valuation methods,
and today, the Internet. Chapter 4 describes the technical subject
areas of financial planning.
5 Create an advisory board. No successful planner has the time
to prospect for new clients, maintain a client base, develop new
products, and remain current with the enormous volume of
fast-changing information affecting the business. You will need
an advisory board of directors to bring expertise, information,
advice, and credibility to your practice. The more impressive
your advisory board, the more certain you should feel about
the quality and professionalism of your practice. Ideally, these
people will provide big-picture guidance: pinpointing poten-
tial pitfalls in your business and marketing plans, providing
solutions to the ongoing practice problems you will inevitably
encounter, and making themselves available for the casual real-
ity checks every business leader needs to fine-tune new ideas.
Chapter 7 explains how to build and sustain an effective advi-
sory board.
6 Build a back-office team. As part of your business infrastruc-
ture, you will need to hire personnel to carry out many of the
tasks described in your business and marketing plans. A part-time
generalist with prior experience in service enterprises is a valuable,
cost-effective investment. You will not want to spend your time
administering the business. Your job will be sales, product devel-
opment, and implementation. Many new financial planners have
tried to run multiple aspects of a new practice. Invariably, the new
financial planner gets diverted in accounting software, business
cards, cold-calling, and other activities better suited to a strong
administrative assistant. Early on, establish a system that enables
your staff to do whatever needs to be done to free you to address
client issues. Build the right culture in your practice from the first
employee forward. See Chapter 6 for more discussion of staffing.
7 Use information technology. In an age in which technology
is a threat and an opportunity for the service provider, it makes
sense to purchase the best technology and train your staff to use
it. This includes business software—for contact management,
graphics, and database creation, for example—and business
hardware—videoconferencing equipment, scanners, and high-
speed/high-resolution printers, for example. Chapter 10 presents
an extensive list and discussion of financial planning software.
8 Develop a marketing plan. A marketing plan is the road map
you follow before and while you inform the public about your
practice. Marketing, like advertising among consumer product
competitors, can be addictive. Many planners do not know when
to start a marketing program, or worse, when to stop. Marketing
a professional financial planning practice does not need to be
expensive, but it needs to be focused and monitored. An impor-
tant element is an analysis of pricing. Product managers, whether
selling a service or cornflakes, have to decide how to price. Is the
goal to optimize price per unit or total units sold? Manufacturing
organizations traditionally strive for high volume with low price
points. Service organizations, on the other hand, tend to strive
for high revenue per unit, as in the case of a consulting firm.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
The financial planner has to make a similar trade-off: many less-
comprehensive planning assignments at lower revenue per unit,
or fewer more-comprehensive planning projects at high revenue
per unit. Chapter 7 will guide you through the development of a
marketing plan.
9 Comply with all regulations. Financial planning is a recog-
nized professional service and is regulated accordingly. With the
immense power to affect client quality of life and financial well-
being comes the obligation to protect the public. Attorneys, physi-
cians, educators, certified public accountants, and other service
providers are governed first by personal ethics but also by profes-
sional licensing bodies and governmental agencies. The financial
planning industry has more regulatory and compliance issues to
address than many other service professions. Chapter 5 leads the
reader through ethical, professional governance, and regulatory
issues facing financial planners in the United States.
10 Develop and implement standardized procedures in your
practice. Establishing an organized and logical set of procedures
is essential to client-centered financial planning. PIPRIM is an
acronym for a systematic approach to assessing and achieving
client financial goals. It spans from the very beginning, when you
first meet a prospective client, through the point of providing
solutions, to measurement of performance. The six-step process
is so comprehensive that it applies to all clients in all phases of a
service relationship. PIPRIM stands for:

```
Preliminary meeting with a client
Integrated goal setting and data gathering
Putting it all together
Recommending solutions
Implementing the plan
Monitoring the plan
```
A complete discussion of the PIPRIM process appears in
Chapter 3.

Selecting a Legal Business Structure
the selection of an appropriate legal business structure is
extremely important. This decision will directly affect many
aspects of your business. The way you can conduct business, the
liability you are willing to assume, your ability to shift income
among family members, the way you receive distributions from
the business, the type of fringe benefits you will want to offer your
employees, and the income tax code applicable to your practice
are affected by the type of business structure you choose.
The selection of a business entity has been broadened through
two trends:
1 The emergence of limited liability partnerships (LLPs).
2 The passage of legislation at the state level allowing for limited
liability companies (LLCs).
```
```
These two options, added to traditional solo and professional
group entities, have made the business structure decision more
complex but more flexible to personal needs. Fee structure
(described in Chapter 6) should not be affected by your choice of
legal business structure. This means your preferred compensation
method should apply in any of the above scenarios. One caution is
to make certain that the state(s) in which you wish to do business
permit the type of legal business structure you intend to choose
in your specific practice (e.g., financial planning, insurance,
investments, or whatever specialty practice you may choose). Also
consider whether you can be licensed as a nonindividual in your
state and still receive commissions under that classification. You
will need to check with state regulatory agencies or legal counsel
to answer these questions.
```
```
SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS
A sole proprietorship is the most common form of business own-
ership due to its relative administrative simplicity. By definition,
it is an unincorporated trade or business owned by a single indi-
vidual. A sole proprietorship is not a legal entity separate and
apart from its owner. The owner’s personal assets are exposed
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
without limitation to any and all liabilities related to the busi-
ness. This unlimited liability exposure is the most significant
difference between sole proprietorships and other business
structures. However, if you are the business’s sole owner, the
only options other than a sole proprietorship are C and S corpo-
rations, and single-member limited-liability companies (LLCs)
in the states that allow them.
Sole proprietorships are easy to establish and require no special
state or federal registration. Sole proprietors simply file a sched-
ule C in addition to personal tax forms. A sole proprietor can use
this business structure to employ family members, thus dispersing
income and tax liability. Because of the sole proprietor’s unlimit-
ed liability, the business must have errors-and-omissions (liability)
insurance to protect the proprietor’s personal assets. In addition,
under a sole proprietorship, there is no flexible ownership, con-
tinuity of life, or capital structure since the business cannot be
transferred, although its assets may be sold.
Generally, start-ups begin as a sole proprietorship, but as the
practice grows, other more flexible financial structures are usually
considered.

```
When to use a sole proprietorship
— If there is only a single owner and single member, LLCs are
not permitted by state law.
— If adequate liability insurance is available at an acceptable
cost.
— If the business is in its early stage and more complex struc-
tures are premature and too costly.
— If the owner is not concerned about transferring interest in
the business in the near term.
```
```
When not to use a sole proprietorship
— If the practice begins generating significant income and
wealth for the owner exposed under an unlimited liability
structure.
— If the owner is concerned about having significant personal
assets at risk under an unlimited liability structure.
— If the practitioner intends to deliver financial services with
inherent exposure to errors-and-omissions claims by clients.
— If there are one or more employees and the owner is con-
cerned about how their independent actions may affect
either the business or clients.
```
```
GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS
A general partnership consists of two or more owners doing busi-
ness with the intention of dividing the income, expenses, and
profit. The legal aspects of general partnerships are governed by
state partnership statutes, most of which are in conformity with
the federal Uniform Partnership Act and the Revised Uniform
Limited Partnership Act. Under law, partners are jointly and
individually liable (without limitation) for all the debts and obli-
gations of the partnership. General partners can also be legally
(and thus financially) responsible for actions taken by each other
when giving the appearance of acting on behalf of the partner-
ship. Because partners are liable to exposing personal assets
through each other’s acts, general partnerships are extremely
risky. Each general partner has the power to act as an agent of the
partnership and to enter into contracts that are legally binding on
the partnership and, ultimately, on the other partners. A partner
may seek legal recourse for reimbursement from the partnership
in excess of his or her share of liabilities, depending on the ability
of the other partners to yield such reimbursement from partner-
ship funds. Partners must have a high level of trust in each other,
although that trust is sometimes misplaced. Many have discovered
that they really did not know their partners at all until after a disil-
lusioning disaster.
Unlike corporations, partnerships offer no continuity of business
life, management controls, or ownership transfer. A general part-
nership is beneficial in the following situations: (1) when a planner
is seeking pass-through taxation; (2) if some or all of the potential
owners are prohibited from being S corporation shareholders; or
(3) if the S corporation single-class-of-stock rule prevents the prin-
cipals from holding the ownership interests they want. Other than
legal restrictions, the level of uncertainty built into the business
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
plan of a financial planning practice should determine whether
the advantages of a partnership outweigh the risks.

```
When to use general partnerships
— If the new business generates significant start-up losses
that can be passed through to the partners, making it more
advantageous than the various restrictions of S corpora-
tions. The partnership is not the tax-paying entity, the own-
ers are. Thus, revenue, profit, losses, deductions, and credit
are passed through the partnership to the principals, who
then report these figures on their personal tax returns.
— If practice pass-through taxation benefits (using a certain
percentage of business profit to pay owners’ taxes) can be
combined with specially tailored ownership interests that
reflect each member’s contributions to the business.
— If cash distributions from the partnership reduce the owners’
basis for taxation. Only distributions in excess of an owner’s
basis can trigger taxable gain.
```
```
When not to use general partnerships
— If multiple owners will not assume common responsibility for
one another’s actions.
— If owners are concerned about having all personal assets at
risk to liability claims.
— If the business intends to deliver financial services with the
inherent risk of errors-and-omissions claims.
```
CORPORATIONS
Corporate structure provides the greatest business and personal
asset protection of any entity. Corporations are of two types, S and
C corporations. These entities are more complex than the previ-
ously discussed options for the financial planner. Corporations
provide significant tax deferral and reduction opportunities but
also limit the owners’ entrepreneurial flexibility.
◆ S corporation. An S corporation is a small business that quali-
fies for and has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity
under federal income tax laws. S corporation shareholders can
choose to receive business profits as dividends. Those dividends
are taxed once as income to the partners—but not twice, as hap-
pens with C corporations, where the partnership and owners pay
taxes on the same income.
S corporations offer a range of significant advantages as well
as shortcomings. On the positive side are limited liability, tax-free
transfer of ownership interests (as long as there are no more than
seventy-five owners), and centralized management and continuity
of business life through stock ownership. The disadvantages include
the filing of the sometimes complex federal tax Form 2553, less
than desirable tax treatment of fringe benefits, limited flexibility
in selecting a tax year, and limited methods to recognize expenses
and to protect income from taxation. In addition, S corporations
are subject to strict eligibility requirements. These requirements
state that the S corporation must have only one class of stock and
must be a domestic corporation having fewer than one hundred
shareholders who are either U.S. citizens or resident aliens, estates,
or certain types of trusts. Financial planning practices other than
S corporations, specifically partnerships and sole ownerships, are at
risk for double taxation. Limited liability and the legal provision for
single taxation of dividends make S corporations very popular.
```
```
When to use S corporations
— If limiting owner liability is a key issue.
— If pass-through taxation is desired.
— If the strict eligibility rules can be met by current and poten-
tial owners.
— If there will be only one owner, LLCs usually are not avail-
able. S corporations are strongly preferred over sole propri-
etorships.
```
```
When not to use S corporations
— If one-person LLCs are available. This entity offers signifi-
cant tax advantages over S corporations.
— If the owners expect to draw high fringe benefits (and thus
expense) and high income. Net income could be reduced by
limited deductibility of fringe benefits and other owner perks.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ C corporation. The C corporation is the most traditional
corporate entity. It provides significant benefits comparable to
those of the S corporation. The pluses include limited liability,
flexible ownership and capital structure, continuity of busi-
ness life, centralized management, and free transferability of
ownership interests (unless limited by a buy-sell agreement).
C corporation tax rates are slightly lower than personal rates:
15 percent on the first $50,000 earned and 25 percent on the
next $25,000. As a result, the C corporation can maximize a
business’s retained earnings. When a business intends to retain
all its earnings for an indefinite period in order to finance its
growth, the difference in tax rates makes C corporations a better
choice than dividend pass-through structures. A dividend pass-
through business might have to distribute up to 39.6 percent of
business income just so the owners can pay their personal taxes.
Finally, C corporations offer better tax treatment for employer-
paid fringe benefits, the ability to select a tax year, and the abil-
ity to take loans from qualified retirement plans.
The limitation of a C corporation is the double tax on profits—
once at the corporate level and again for individuals receiving
income distribution. However, the double taxation burden is less-
ened by the relatively low corporate tax rate and by the favorable
offset of shareholder-employees’ salaries and benefit expenses
against income. In addition, C corporations can often solve the
double taxation problem by “zeroing out” corporate income
with deductible payments to or for the benefit of shareholders
and employees. Such payments can be for salary, fringe benefits,
interest on shareholder loans, and rent for property owned by
shareholders. Unlike an S corporation or a sole proprietorship,
C corporations do not provide for shareholders to shift income
among family members. Thus, the C corporation structure
should be reserved for financial planners who intend larger-scale,
multiple-specialty, nonfamily businesses.

```
When to use C corporations
— If protection of the owners’ personal assets from business
liability is a significant concern.
— If the business plan assumes one owner and single-member
LLCs are not permitted by state law.
— If the benefits of pass-through taxation are not important to
the owners.
— If the owners foresee the possible need to borrow against
their qualified retirement plan accounts.
— If the owners want to maximize retained earnings to finance
business expansion and capital projects.
```
```
When not to use C corporations
— If the owners foresee the trade-off between double taxation
and business expense deductions to be unfavorable. Double
taxation can result from dividend distributions, sale of stock,
or liquidation or appreciation of assets, such as real estate.
If real estate assets can be owned by a pass-through entity
that, in turn, is owned by C corporation shareholders, the
real estate can then be leased back to the C corporation.
With this arrangement, the C corporation can reduce its
taxable income by making deductible rental payments that
benefit its shareholders. Any gains upon the eventual sale
of the appreciated assets owned by the pass-through entity
will not be subject to double taxation.
— If the business owners distribute most of the income to
themselves. Such a business should operate instead as a
pass-through entity.
```
```
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are becoming more popu-
lar because they combine the best legal and tax characteristics
of corporations and partnerships while avoiding many of the
disadvantages. An LLC offers limited liability protection to all of
its owners (called members) but still is treated as a partnership
under federal income tax rules. Therefore, LLCs are unincorpo-
rated legal entities governed by state law and are not subject to
restrictions on corporations or partnerships.
An LLC is a slightly tricky legal entity. It is a separate being
from its members, and it owns assets and is liable for debts.

Therefore, the personal assets of an LLC member are generally
beyond the reach of LLC creditors or other members. LLCs also
have liberal ownership rules. Some states require a minimum of
two members, others require only one. LLC covenants do not per-
mit tax-free transferability of ownership interests. Fringe benefits
and selection of tax year are unfavorably treated by LLC tax rules.
Because LLCs are a relatively new type of business structure, there
is a paucity of legal precedents available to guide tax courts and
regulatory agencies in governing LLC business practices. Some
states may not recognize one-person LLCs or permit certain
lines of business to use the LLC structure. Because all members
may participate fully in LLC management without losing limited
liability protection, LLCs are ideal for closely held financial plan-
ning practices.

those in general partnerships, LLP partners are not liable for one

demise one of the nation’s top accounting firms, is a well-known
example of the potentially ruinous consequences of joint partner
liability; in that case, the firm collapsed under the weight of dev-

as in Texas, where LLCs are taxed on an entity level but LLPs
are not.

ciated property and create different types of partnership inter-
ests with varying rights to cash flow, liquidation proceeds, and
tax allocations prohibited to S corporations.

When not to use LLPs
— When state law does not offer LLC-like liability protection to
LLP partners.
— If state law does not permit this structure.
— When qualifying as an S corporation is more convenient and
you want the transferability of ownership through stock.
— If the partner can “zero out” the double taxation of C cor-
porations with deductible payments to or for the benefit of
the owners.

```
Finding a Mentor
successful practitioners in most fields of professional
accomplishment, from music to medicine, look forward to the
time when they can act as a mentor and take others under their
wing. Ensuring smooth passage of a trade to a qualified next
generation plus the personal satisfaction derived from helping
others succeed are fundamental to the mentor’s motivation. Men-
tors are teachers who provide specific guidance to novices. They
teach techniques that have made them successful, and they are
often looking to give back to their profession or community. This
concept fits the financial planner profession as well.
The mentor relationship is an extremely important one for
many reasons. First, most students and planners first entering
this field have little or no practical experience in dealing with
clients or the technical aspects of the business. Many of these
students come from fields unrelated to finance. In addition, the
interpersonal dynamics of the provider/client relationship are
not replicated in other fields. The mentor’s role is to prescribe a
series of do’s and don’ts to guide new planners along the path to
professionalism, competency, and success. Mentors will help pri-
oritize what needs to be done and will coach the student through
the planning process described in Chapter 3.
Second, students of financial planning lack technical experi-
ence. Planners must be well educated in multiple disciplines of
financial planning, including insurance, investments, education
funding, retirement, income tax, and estate planning, among
others. The future planner must know how to explain a financial
objective to a client in very easy to understand terms, including
the cost, the expected return, and the financial plan needed to
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
accomplish the desired results. Because the knowledge base is so
vast, few planners can be expert in all areas; today planners should
specialize in a financial planning subfield, since it is important to
differentiate themselves. Mentors are frequently specialists who
train students to become experts in their field and expand the
total knowledge base for the next generation.
Where can you find mentors? Try your local Financial Planning
Association (FPA) society. Many have organized programs that
give new members the opportunity to work with mentors and to
form discussion groups focusing on specifics they find in practice.
Often students are allowed to join at reduced prices.
Internships are another alternative. There are many practitio-
ners willing to hire interns, generally on an unpaid or nominal-
pay basis, in exchange for the experience that will assist them
greatly in their first jobs. These internships can be found through
finance and accounting departments of colleges and universities
as well as through local organizations, such as the FPA.
Because of the complexities of financial planning work, work-
ing with a mentor in this type of arrangement is an excellent
opportunity for newcomers to the profession, especially for those
at midcareer transition. Many midcareer entrants to the field have
sufficient funds to hold them over temporarily so they can get the
needed experience to come out of the gate running. The other
advantage to guidance from a mentor is that it is better to learn
on someone else’s nickel! In other words, you are better off mak-
ing mistakes with someone who can then show you a better way to
handle issues and minimize your learning curve. When you feel
confident about handling difficult client issues, then you will be
on your way to becoming an independent financial planner.

Getting the Credentials

what kind of background does one need to be a successful
financial planner? How can you differentiate yourself from the
other 250,000 self-described financial planners? Is it beneficial
to earn a specialty designation? These are questions you need
to consider when entering this profession. The fact is that more
and more planners are earning professional designations and

certifications. The drive to demonstrate professional expertise in
specialty fields is definitely on the rise.
The personal financial planning certification process protects
the public by ensuring a minimum level of competence among
service providers through the successful completion of a certify-
ing examination. Certification improves the personal financial
planning skills of practitioners, resulting in increased professional
competence across the industry. It enhances the profession’s
image as one that requires rigorous training. Furthermore, it
helps keep the practitioner up-to-date with new developments in
the profession. Once certified with any professional designation,
practitioners need to take continuing education classes.
Following is a discussion of the most widely held designations
financial planners pursue. Certification requirements are from
the administering organization’s official guidebook. For more
information, contact the appropriate organizations listed here.
```
```
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER (CFP)
CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
The CFP designation is offered by the CFP Board of Standards
and has four initial requirement categories: education, examina-
tion, experience, and ethics.
1 Education. Before taking the certification examination, you
must first complete the academic financial planning curriculum.
The CFP Board does not specify or publish an official study man-
ual; however, completion of the curriculum is available through
three educational paths—registered program, challenge status,
or transcript review.
The registered program encompasses many college or uni-
versity classes affiliated with the CFP Board. Each CFP Board
Registered Program provides coverage of all topics determined
by the CFP Board to constitute the core curriculum for personal
financial planning practitioners. Registered institutions present-
ing these programs often do so under different course names, yet
they must cover the required content. More than three hundred
programs are now registered with the CFP Board, and a new
type of boot-camp format—Financial Planning Fast Track—
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
provides a revolutionary way of obtaining the necessary educa-
tion. For more information, visit [http://www.financialplanningfasttrack](http://www.financialplanningfasttrack)
.com. These programs are neither approved nor disapproved
by the CFP Board. Rather, they are registered as having met the
CFP Board’s requirements to ensure that the appropriate cur-
riculum will be covered so that students can be prepared for the
examination.
There is no time limit between completion of a CFP Board
Registered Program and sitting for the Certification Examination.
The educational program is designed to cover all of the tested
topics; however, in reality it may not be adequate preparation for
the examination. You should check with the registered institution
to determine what the pass rate has been for students complet-
ing its program. The list of registered programs is available
in the CFP Board’s General Information Book on its website,
[http://www.CFP-Board.org.](http://www.CFP-Board.org.)
Aspirants who already hold certain degrees and professional
credentials are allowed to sit for the Certification Examination
without having to verify their educational preparation. The fol-
lowing degrees and credentials have been approved by the CFP
Board as fulfilling the education requirement: Certified Public
Accountant (CPA), licensed and/or inactive attorney, Char-
tered Financial Consultant (ChFC), Chartered Life Underwriter
(CLU), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Ph.D. in economics
or business, and Doctor of Business Administration.
The transcript review process is applicable to aspirants who
have already completed the necessary coursework to sit for the
Certification Examination. The CFP Board may waive some or
all of the education component required for certification if
the applicant can demonstrate successful completion of upper-
division-level college or university coursework and the applicant is
a holder in good standing of a CFP Board–recognized credential
that can be transferred to meet the education requirement. Exam-
ine the checklist on the transcript review application to determine
if you have completed some or all of the mandated courses.
The CFP Board also recommends courses in finance, account-
ing, economics, computer programming, and communica-

tions, especially for those who are new to the area of financial
services.
2 Examination. When you have successfully completed the
coursework or have satisfied the examination challenge require-
ment, you are eligible to apply for the ten-hour certification
examination. It is administered three times a year, generally on
the third Friday and Saturday in March, July, and November. The
test is divided into one four-hour session (Friday afternoon) and
two three-hour sessions (Saturday).
The test is designed to assess your ability to apply your finan-
cial planning education to financial planning situations and your
understanding of the requirements of a successful CFP licensee.
These requirements, which are updated approximately every five
years, are derived from an extensive job analysis that specifies
what CFP licensees do in practice. These requirements cover the
areas of investment planning, estate planning, individual income
tax planning, retirement planning, risk management, insurance,
and finance.
3 Experience. To become certified you will also need work
experience in personal financial planning to show that you have
acquired the counseling skills that are part of the job. The usual
requirement is three years, performed before or after successfully
completing the certification examination, but exceptions apply
in certain situations, such as five years’ full-time experience with-
out an undergraduate degree. Six months’ experience must be
gained within twelve months of submitting the résumé form, and
internship programs may qualify for partial credit.
4 Ethics. Once you have completed the education and experi-
ence requirements, you will receive a declaration packet that
includes an ethics statement form and your license application
with a bill for your initial licensee fee. Before certification, you
must disclose past or pending litigation or agency proceedings
and acknowledge the right of the CFP Board to enforce its Code
of Ethics and Professional Responsibility through the due process
described in its Disciplinary Rules and Procedures. If you have any
questions about the effect of any past or pending action on your
certification, you may contact the CFP Board counsel directly.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Becoming a CFP licensee is a good idea if you are concerned
about designation recognition. With more than 73,000 CFP licens-
ees in the marketplace, it is far and away the most popular designa-
tion, which should prove valuable in establishing credibility with
consumers. Also, the name itself—Certified Financial Planner—
resembles other licenses and designations that incorporate the
term _certified_ and as such is readily recognizable to the consumer/
client. For more information, contact the CFP Board at 888-CFP-
MARK (888-237-6275) or visit its website at [http://www.CFP-Board.org.](http://www.CFP-Board.org.)

PERSONAL FINANCIAL SPECIALIST (PFS)
INITIAL ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS
To qualify for the PFS designation, which is offered by the Ameri-
can Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), you must:
◆ Be a member in good standing of the AICPA. This means being
a licensed CPA and not having any professional or ethical viola-
tions against you.
◆ Hold a valid and unrevoked CPA certificate issued by a legally
constituted state authority.
◆ Have at least 250 hours of experience per year in personal finan-
cial planning activities for the three years immediately preceding
the application. These activities must include the following:
—Personal financial planning
—Personal income tax planning
—Risk management planning
—Investment planning
—Retirement planning
—Estate planning
◆ Agree to comply with all the requirements for reaccreditation
after you earn the right to use the PFS mark. These include earn-
ing continuing education credits and submitting three client ref-
erences every time you apply for renewal.
◆ Pass the PFS examination. This examination is a six-hour
practice-oriented exam. There are no formal education require-
ments or specific course topics as with the CFP Certification
Examination. Rather, the test is based on one’s practical knowl-
edge as a CPA specializing in financial planning.


```
Foundations of a Financial Planning Career
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
◆ Satisfy a point system, whereby successful attainment of profes-
sional designations, examinations, authoring of books or articles
will go toward these requirements.
◆ Submit six written references that discuss your working experi-
ence in personal financial planning.
```
```
This designation is especially meaningful when you have an
active CPA practice and want to branch out and become a special-
ist in financial planning. Since it is limited to practicing CPAs only,
it has never attracted the number of designates that the CFP mark
has. To date, very few CPAs have earned this designation. To receive
additional information, contact the AICPA at 888-777-7077 or

◆ Pass the Level I, Level II, and Level III examinations, which test
three levels of investment analysis; the exams are offered once a year.
◆ Have at least four years of acceptable professional experience
working in an investment decision-making capacity. Acceptable
work experience means performing, teaching, or supervising
the collection, evaluation, or application of financial, economic,
or statistical data as part of the investment decision-making pro-
cess. Eligibility of a candidate’s experience for meeting the CFA
requirements is reviewed only after the candidate passes the first
examination.
◆ Apply concurrently for membership in the CFA Institute and
in a local member society (these local organizations are affiliates
of the CFA Institute).
◆ Sign and submit a professional conduct statement.
◆ Sign and submit a form agreeing to comply with CFA Institute
rules and ethical standards.
◆ Exhibit a high degree of ethical and professional conduct.

This designation focuses on investment calculations. It is very
specific to investment and does not emphasize a comprehensive
approach toward financial planning. If you want to become an
investment specialist, then earning a CFA is highly worthwhile.

CHARTERED FINANCIAL CONSULTANT (ChFC)
REQUIREMENTS
Through self-study courses offered by the American College of Bryn
Mawr, Pennsylvania, students are eligible to become candidates for
a Huebner School Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) designa-
tion. The program to obtain this designation requires coursework,
three years of business experience, and thirty hours of continuing
professional education every two years, along with maintenance of
ethical standards. An undergraduate or graduate degree from an
accredited institution qualifies as one year of business experience.
Examinations are administered after each course. Ten courses are
needed to obtain the ChFC designation.

Licensing Requirements for Insurance
and Investment Advisory Practitioners
```
```
financial planners who want to become fee-based investment
advisers need to pass the so-called Series 65 or Series 66 securities
examinations. These tests generally are a prerequisite to becom-
ing a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) in most states. How-
ever, if you plan to go for your CFP, PFS, or ChFC designation,
obtain that first, because many states now waive the Series 65 or
66 exams if the applicant possesses any one of those designations.
Note, however, that some states may require you to pass the Series
6 or Series 7 exam in addition to either passing the Series 65 or
66 exam or obtaining the financial planning designation waiver.
Check with your state licensing board first.
If you are interested in becoming a commission-based invest-
ment salesperson, generally it is better to take the Series 7 exam
rather than the Series 6. Passing the Series 7 provides you with
the opportunity to sell more products, such as stocks, bonds,
options, mutual funds, variable life, and variable annuities,
whereas the Series 6 enables you to sell only mutual funds and
variable insurance products. If you want to sell life, health, and
disability insurance products, you need to obtain a life and
health insurance license. If you wish to sell automobile, home
owners, and umbrella insurance, you will need a property and
casualty license.
The easiest way to obtain your licenses for insurance or invest-
ment advising is to affiliate with a financial services organization
that will sponsor you, such as a brokerage or insurance com-
pany. Such firms usually will pay your licensing fees and provide
you with the training necessary to pass the examinations. This
approach will enable you to get your licenses quickly and easily
while learning about the industry firsthand.

DESIGNATION CONSIDERATIONS
Many of the designations discussed above originated in related
industries. The ChFC designation, for example, is an offshoot of
the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation, which has
existed in the life insurance industry for many years. Planners
holding the ChFC designation often approach planning issues
more from an insurance perspective, given that the primary train-
ing associated with this designation reflects that orientation while
also incorporating other elements of the financial planning pro-
cess. For a planner with a strong interest in insurance concerns
who wishes to become a specialist in this area, the ChFC or CLU
title may be the most appropriate. However, it is worth noting that
this designation is not well known or understood by the general
public; in fact consumers may tend to view ChFCs as strictly sell-
ers of insurance products due to an association of the mark with
that industry.
CPAs wishing to emphasize their financial planning skills can
obtain the PFS certification, which, as noted previously, is open
only to CPAs and denotes the CPA as a financial planning special-
ist. The drawback of this mark, however, is that it has not been
heavily promoted to the public as a mainstream designation, so
that most consumers are unfamiliar with it. This in part reflects
the fact that the AICPA has not rallied around this specific desig-
nation since many within the organization want to promote the
CPA holder as the financial planner of choice. In fact, one faction
holds that the CPA degree itself confers the appropriate skills
necessary to be a competent financial planner.
However, CPA training in and of itself does not provide expo-
sure to the spectrum of skills needed by the planner. The full
range of these disciplines, discussed in Chapter 4, is usually not
found in the standard college and university accounting curri-
cula. On the other hand, some AICPA members believe that an
accounting specialty for financial planners is warranted. They see
CPAs who practice as Certified Financial Planner specialists as
analogous to physicians and lawyers who practice in specialties.
These conflicting views among its constituency have made it diffi-
cult for the AICPA to lend major support to a single designation.

The must-have certification for practitioners wanting to
denote their financial planning specialization is the Certified
Financial Planner (CFP) designation. Held by more than 73,000
planners, this is the best-known mark that the public associates
with the financial planning profession. The press often includes
the CFP designation along with a planner’s name after a quote
in a newspaper or magazine. Since the mark is the predominant
one among financial planners who hold designations, industry
representatives who are CFP licensees tend to have more clout
with regulators. Also, consolidation has occurred within the
financial planning industry, notably the International Asso-
ciation for Financial Planning (IAFP) and Institute of Certified
Financial Planners’ (ICFP’s) historic January 1, 2000, merger
into a single professional organization, the Financial Planning
Association (FPA). The American College, sponsor of the once
rival ChFC mark, now also offers training leading to the CFP des-
ignation and has become the largest enrollment base for those
hoping to become licensed as Certified Financial Planners. All
these factors suggest that the CFP program is likely to continue
to predominate as the industry standard in the profession in the
years to come.
For planners seeking a formalized training program, the
CFP designation provides the most comprehensive and generic
industry training. Since one of the requirements for obtaining
the mark is to go through an education program covering a man-
dated range of topics, would-be planners have an opportunity to
receive adequate training in the full spectrum of planning disci-
plines, which is especially valuable both for novices and for plan-
ners entering from other industries.
Other designations, namely the CFA and RIA, do not provide for
a comprehensive approach to the entire range of financial planning
services. They are for planners wishing to highlight an industry spe-
cialty in investment planning and advising, but these designations
do not suggest a practice with broad financial planning.

creating the client management procedures, meth-

ods, and tools to get started as a financial planner is fun-

damental to success. Like an attorney or CPA, a financial

planner needs to master the content of the profession,

then develop good client management skills to put the

theory into practice. The preliminary steps to establishing

your financial planning practice, such as deciding what

type of business structure to adopt and the other crucial

initial tasks, are outlined in Chapter 2. The final step among the
“must-do’s” is to design and perfect a client management system
for your practice—the steps and procedures you will use over
and over again to take your clients’ needs to results. Your client
management system will become turnkey in that each new client
relationship will follow the same planning process: one key opens
one door to all clients for your services.
Your client management approach must become so automatic
and fail-safe that any planning associate on your staff can perform
client services in the same way. Repetition and fine-tuning of “best
practices” leads to a superior client management system, competi-
tive advantage, and better client results. Your methodology must
be efficient, manageable, and perhaps most important, easy to
execute. In essence, a well-developed turnkey client management
system takes the planner’s practice to the next level of profession-
alism, quality, and productivity.
The client management approach introduced in Chapter 2
is described by the acronym PIPRIM, outlining the six straight-
forward but crucial activities involved in financial planning. This
chapter takes you through each step in detail and provides a com-
plete methodology for managing clients.

BEFORE YOU MEET THE CLIENT, UNDERSTAND YOUR ROLE
Financial planning is a process that concludes as a highly person-
alized service. It is not a product, bought and consumed by the cli-
ent. Rather, financial planning is a cycle that constantly renews as
client needs change over time. Your clients must understand and
accept the fundamental nature of the financial planning process
if they are to value your services. Your job is not to make clients
rich, as a stockbroker might. Rather, your role is to probe and
study your clients’ needs, lead them through the PIPRIM system,
and prepare a financial plan for now and for the future.
Unlike stocks that are bought and sold, a financial plan is long-
range. You and your clients are investing in a relationship that
must weather short-term gains and setbacks. Your ability to main-
tain client confidence is dependent not on the dollar gain from
the financial plan but rather on the integrity of your relationship
and the financial planning system you employ. In the end, clients
will be financially independent if the process you follow has been
tested, challenged, and improved with each engagement. Your
clients will expect nothing less.
```
```
A NOTE ABOUT ETHICS
Your role is to help clients achieve financial well-being. This
requires that you accept and occupy a position of trust. Financial
planners, like other service professionals, are by definition held
to a high standard of ethics, since clients entrust them with their
financial future. Planners must put client interests above their
own and ensure that objectivity and independence are never
compromised.
The Certified Financial Planner Board has prepared a Code of
Ethics and Professional Responsibility. This invaluable guide for the
financial planner ensures that the practitioner is employing the
“right environment for the clients.” The CFP Board has initiated
the challenge of elevating the status of the profession, for CFP
licensees and non–CFP licensees alike, through the creation and
promulgation of this professional practice standard. All financial
planners should understand and apply this code consistently in
every client assignment. Through self-directed standards, the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
financial planning professional will continue to invest in his or
her own future. Section I of the _Code of Ethics and Professional
Responsibility_ appears in Appendix A.

A PROSPECT CALLS
On day one of your career as a financial planner, you need to
be ready for your first contact with a prospective client. It is not as
simple as picking up the telephone and talking. Remember that
lasting impressions are made in the first few sentences of any con-
versation, whether face-to-face or over the telephone.
What do you say when someone calls you on a referral from a
colleague or friend? First, do not try to “sell” anything. Rather,
you need to conduct yourself in a manner consistent with the
credibility you have already achieved from the referral source.
The reputation of the person who referred you is on the line, too.
Next, remember that the prospect does not really know what to
ask for—that is why you are being contacted. Resist diagnosing
the prospect’s situation on the first call. More important, do not
offer advice. Keep the conversation light and informal, but profes-
sional. Thank the prospect for the call, then explain your back-
ground and, very briefly, how you work with clients. While you are
not attempting to gain a commitment in the first conversation,
you are trying to establish enough interest for the prospect to take
the next step, a meeting.
In general, the flow of the first conversation with a prospect is
as follows: The prospect may approach you with a specific ques-
tion, express various concerns, or indicate a need for direction.
Assume that the prospect calls you and wants to know what finan-
cial planning is all about. What do you say?

```
SCENARIO 1
Prospect: I got your name from a mutual friend, Bill Williams.
He said you might have some ideas. I have questions con-
cerning some immediate financial issues that I haven’t really
planned for.
Planner: I appreciate the call, what are your concerns?
Prospect: My son will attend college in three years, but I would
```

```
Developing a Client Management System
```

```
also like to seriously plan for retirement just about when he
finishes school. I’m not sure how to handle both.
Planner: That’s a challenge but not impossible. [Offer con-
firmation of the problem, but link yourself to a professional
solution.] I specialize in both of those areas, and have helped
many people build a financial plan to meet personal goals. My
approach is to first of all meet a prospective client, understand
the current financial situation, and, assuming there is a good
match between your goals and my capabilities, build a financial
plan. The best way to start is with an informal meeting in my
office to study your situation more closely. Would you be will-
ing? [Some planners like to offer a free thirty-minute consul-
tation. While this approach works for some prospects, it may
cheapen the service to others. Price should not be the motivat-
ing factor for a client to retain a financial planner.]
Prospect: Sure, it’s certainly worth an hour of my time to learn
more. When should I come in?
```
```
SCENARIO 2
Prospect: I have heard that you work with people in need of
financial advice—that’s me.
Planner: I do have several new clients whose financial goals
range from very general to specific. What advice are you look-
ing for? [Do not attempt to stretch your client base, exper-
tise, or specialization beyond reality. It is more credible to
state your credentials and limitations up front, particularly if
you are new.]
Prospect: I don’t have a great deal of money to worry about,
but I’m concerned about what I do have. I need advice so I
don’t make decisions now that I’ll regret in the future. Can I
even afford professional advice with a bank account my size?
Planner: It’s not the size of the bank account now that is
important, it’s the size you’ll need to meet your goals. [It is
very important to get people thinking about goals from the
beginning. Without goals, the prospect cannot value the finan-
cial future you will chart through a plan.] I think the best way to
proceed would be a no-obligation meeting in my office. We can
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
```
talk more about your current situation and start setting some
goals. [In this scenario, a “no-obligation” meeting does make
sense because the prospect has already established limited
resources.] Would you be interested?
Prospect: Since it’s no obligation, I can afford that. When
should I come in?
```
SCENARIO 3
Prospect: My attorney, Lester Jones, referred me to you. He
speaks very highly of the way you have started your financial
services practice.
Planner: Yes, Lester and I have known each other for a long
time. He is very good; we have worked together with common
clients. [Since the prospect respects Mr. Jones, mention situ-
ations when you have worked together. This gives you fast and
unquestioned credibility.] What are your particular financial
issues?
Prospect: I have a significant and growing income every year,
yet I worry that almost all of it goes to taxes or just evaporates.
I hate to say it, but there is social pressure to drive the right car
and go to the right vacation spots in my circle of friends. They
seem to afford it all, but I can’t anymore. I need a financial plan
before I spend my family into ruin. I need advice, and quick.
Planner: Let me first say, you’re not alone. Very few people
have the discipline and fewer have a financial plan to manage
money. I recently worked with a family in a similar situation.
The process leading to financial security was difficult for this
couple, but we worked together and continue to work together.
I was able to help them set financial goals, prioritize their cur-
rent needs, and feel comfortable with financial decisions in
spite of the urge to spend. I would be happy to show you the
format of the plan I created for this family. It might take an
hour of your time, but you’ll see the benefit. When could we
meet? [In this example, the prospect is expressing self-doubt
and is looking for confirmation that there is a solution. Without
promising results, the financial planner offered a true case
study. This told the prospect two things: (1) there are other


```
Developing a Client Management System
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
people with the same problem, and (2) there are solutions.
The planner was fairly assertive in asking for a meeting. This
prospect cannot afford to turn down the offer. There was no
need to bring up “no obligation.”]
```
```
these are scenarios that financial planners run into constantly.
They all begin with a specific or vague problem, concern,
or need. However, you approach every situation the same
way. Communicate understanding, give examples of similar
situations you have addressed, and never diagnose or promise
anything over the phone. Never provide free advice. Always
invite the prospect to come into the office for a thirty- to sixty-
minute initial consultation. Mention “no obligation” only if asked
or if you think the issue of payment could be a demotivator. This
meeting allows you and the prospective client to find out whether
a legitimate need exists, whether your client management system
can help, and whether there is adequate symbiosis to sustain a
relationship.
Once you have set a date and time for your initial consultation,
keep the interest level warm by sending the prospect a follow-up
packet of information introducing yourself and your firm. This
shows the prospect that you are serious about helping, and it gives
factual information to increase confidence in your ability and to
confirm that talking with you was the right decision. Every interac-
tion with a prospect is important. You want to control the image
you portray and sustain interest at the same time.
EXHIBITS 3.1 AND 3.2 (see pages 75–77) show a sample packet
adapted from one used by Garrett Financial Planning in Over-
land Park, Kansas. The letter should be short, professional, goal
focused, nonintimidating, and motivating. Give the prospect good
reasons to want to do business with you. The information packet
must not be overwhelming; it must establish your background,
credentials, and track record; and it must include preparation
work sheets (homework) to discuss at the first meeting. The infor-
mation packet is not a sales pitch. The more you say, the greater
the potential for overkill.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
```
Step 1:
Preliminary Meeting with the Client
```
you and the prospect have taken the first step. You have agreed
on the practical value of investing one hour of time in each
other. You have set up an appointment and have provided the
prospect background information and homework. The meeting
time has arrived, and the prospect is waiting in your reception
area. A strong, friendly, and confident greeting is important to
first impressions. By all means, greet the prospect yourself. Do
not send an assistant or ask the prospect to find his or her way
to your office.

```
Welcome to Financial Planning Associates, John. Did you have
any trouble finding us or parking? Downtown is a disaster
these days with the new one-way traffic rules. Did you have
a chance to read the information packet I sent you and to fill
out the personal financial profile? Great. We will start with an
overview of your current situation, talk about your goals, and
see if I can’t find a way to help you.
```
During the preliminary meeting in your office, which typically
lasts thirty to sixty minutes, you and the prospect will explore, and
ultimately conclude, whether your abilities match the prospect’s
needs. Prospective clients will give you either too much or too
little information about themselves and their financial aspira-
tions. You will need to constantly stop the conversation, repeat
your understanding of what the prospect has said, and move the
conversation forward step-by-step. You will, of course, ask yourself
if you can work closely and successfully together. Be sure you talk
about the following issues:
◆ Why is the prospect here?
◆ What is the prospect’s current financial situation?
◆ What are the prospect’s immediate and long-term needs?
◆ Is the prospect capable of helping design and implement a
financial plan, taking charge of his or her success?


```
Developing a Client Management System
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
◆ Is there confluence between your financial and investment
philosophies?
◆ What services can you apply to the prospect’s needs?
◆ Do you have a strong initial sense that you can help?
◆ How would the prospect benefit from your service portfolio?
◆ What is the estimated time frame to complete the plan and
accomplish goals?
◆ What compensation models apply to this prospect’s situation?
◆ Is your role likely to be adviser, motivator, teacher, or director? Are
you ready to take on any or all of these roles with this individual?
```
```
The most important part of the initial meeting is to get the
prospect to summarize the discussion in his or her own words.
Do not be afraid to ask the prospect, “What do you think?” If the
prospect can more clearly see how his or her financial situation
can be improved through a co-administered financial plan, the
message has succeeded. The prospect’s own verbalization is req-
uisite to commitment.
If you and the prospect have reached a clear understanding of
needs and capabilities and reasonable confidence in the potential
for results, you should suggest the next step. Schedule a follow-
up meeting within the next two weeks. Meet as soon as possible
to maintain momentum and commitment. A plan to reconvene
within two weeks will help the prospect stay focused and thinking
about the tasks to be accomplished before your next appoint-
ment. Do give the prospect an assignment: for example, to rank
his financial goals by importance, time frame, and degree of mon-
etary risk he is willing to accept.
No more than two days after the initial meeting, summarize
your understanding in an engagement letter. By now the prospect
knows that the free meetings are over. You have started to deliver
value, professional knowledge, and commitment of your time. It is
totally reasonable for you to now draft an engagement letter gov-
erning the transition from prospect to client relationship. EXHIBIT
3.3 (see pages 78–80) shows a sample engagement letter. This
particular example is designed for performing comprehensive
financial planning services.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Ask the client to read the agreement carefully and call you with
any questions. Many prospective clients will have little experience
with legal agreements or contracts. Your attorney should review
the language in the letter of engagement before you send it. Do
not be surprised if the letter gets to the prospect’s attorney, who
will undoubtedly find ways to amend the letter to his client’s
advantage. Try to avoid the cost and delay of two attorneys work-
ing out the details of phraseology. Once all parties are satisfied,
have the prospect sign and return the letter to you before your
next meeting. If the engagement letter is not signed before your
second meeting, hold off on working with the prospect until the
letter is signed. This document describes in legal terms the obliga-
tions of the client and planner in a contractual relationship.
The second meeting, usually lasting sixty minutes or more, is to
start designing a working relationship. This session is in essence
a test of what the next ten to fifteen hours of planning would be
like with this client. If the client passes your _team test,_ and if you
pass your client’s _credibility test,_ then you are in a position to pro-
ceed to the next step—the integrated goal-orientation and data-
gathering session.

```
Step 2:
Integrated Goal Setting and Data Gathering
```
in the third session with your client, you will start researching
and collecting information that will help you design and imple-
ment a successful financial plan. The meeting should last for as
much time as you need; some planners spend as much as two
hours with a client in this meeting.

FORMULATION OF GOALS
Begin by asking clients to describe their goals as explicitly as pos-
sible. Point out to the client that as more information is provided,
the plan becomes more concrete. You cannot gather too much;
all information is useful either now or later. At this stage, your
job is to take in everything clients can tell you about themselves
and their financial aspirations. Do not attempt to go through


```
Developing a Client Management System
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
the details of all the information the client provides at this time.
Rather, skim through it to ensure that you have everything signifi-
cant. During the actual formation of the plan, you will review this
information again in detail.
It is important that the third session be interactive. You must
probe clients with open-ended questions designed to elicit
nonfinancial as well as financial information, since both signifi-
cantly affect the development of the plan. Your questions must
be direct, targeting the goals that have been discussed or written
down previously. As noted above, you will go through the infor-
mation in detail later, as you formulate a financial plan.
If you are working with clients who are life partners, be sure to
meet with them together. Spouses and partners often give con-
tradictory information to the same questions. Meet as a triad to
ensure that you have a common and focused set of goals.
Your questions can be divided into two sections: those that
address specifics of the client’s financial situation and those that
address the client’s goals. The first area to elucidate is the client’s
vision of the ideal future life, which will become the basis for
financial goals. Both should be stated as explicitly as possible.
Clients must clearly articulate their picture of the future, and
you must restate this vision in goals that the client can reasonably
achieve. Unrealistic goals are damaging to the client, to his or her
family, and to your relationship and reputation.
```
```
FORMULATION OF OBJECTIVES
Goals are by definition long-term descriptions of a future condi-
tion. Objectives are the short-term steps to a goal. Setting objec-
tives is the heart of planning, because they define what the client
expects to achieve through the financial planning process.
Pay careful attention to both the broad, relatively open-ended
forecasts of what the client wants to achieve (goals) and how those
goals translate into specific objectives. Clients sometimes tell plan-
ners that they want to be rich. What does that really mean? How
does the client define rich? Specific objectives, on the other hand,
are quantifiable and provide you with a road map to meeting a cli-
ent’s needs. For a particular client, rich might mean retiring in a
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
certain number of years with a specific lifestyle. Perhaps a couple
wishes to retire at age fifty with $1 million in the bank, or at age
sixty with an income of $100,000 a year, or with enough residual
wealth to pay for the educational needs of an unknown number of
grandchildren. These are specific, meaningful goals, and you can
design strategies to achieve them. Objectives, therefore, are both
definite (specific time frame) and measurable (dollar amount).
Once the client has stated clear, quantifiable outcomes for
financial planning, the next step is to rank those objectives in
order of importance. Most clients will not be able to achieve
all their objectives fully. None but the truly wealthy clients will
have sufficient resources to accomplish more than a few of their
objectives. You need to tell the client this up front before the
plan is prepared. You must force your clients to be realists. Oddly
enough, if they were realists from the beginning, they probably
would not need your services. Explain that based on their current
financial condition and future outlook, they can totally achieve
one or two objectives, but at the expense of others. A client’s
objectives may be at cross-purposes, one competing with another.
Not bringing this conflict to the client’s attention and reaching
consensus is an ethical breach of confidence.
The most common reason that a client seeks legal restitution
from a financial planner is a promise of more service or financial
gain than is either perceived or actually delivered. Often the cli-
ent fails to understand or accept the risk involved in preparing a
financial plan, blaming the planner for weak results. Other times
the financial planner fails to remind the client verbally _and_ in
writing of the inherent risk in financial planning. In either case,
client expectations have not been properly set or managed. (See
Chapter 8 for more detail on managing client expectations.)
Consider a hypothetical client who has interview appointments
with two planners. The client’s goals are sufficient net assets for
retirement and long-term earnings on assets equal to or greater
than average interest rates. The client is willing to take on low to
moderate investment risk. Planner 1 meets with the client and,
after analyzing his portfolio, tells the client that he can get him a
40 percent annual rate of return with moderate risk. The client


```
Developing a Client Management System
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
then sees planner 2 and poses the same goals. After careful delib-
eration, planner 2 tells the client that he can probably achieve an
8 percent rate of return with moderate risk. Not knowing whom to
trust, the client invests half his portfolio with each planner. A year
goes by during which both planners deliver a 20 percent return.
The client is pleased with planner 2, who did 12 percent better
than he had predicted, but is angry with planner 1, whose strategy
underperformed by 20 percent. Both planners offered their best
prediction of future asset performance and risk. Still, planner 1
in a sense “guaranteed” a 40 percent return. Not only was this
imprudent, but it could be interpreted as willful. This could be
the basis of a malpractice lawsuit, which, win or lose, is devastat-
ing to a planner’s reputation. It is crucial to be realistic with your
clients and protect yourself from any remote misinterpretation.
```
```
SPECIFIC CLIENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
◆ A client is concerned about his family’s financial well-being in
the event of his or her death. A life insurance plan can be pur-
chased to neutralize this worry. Life insurance protects against the
following:
—Loss of the client’s future earning power in the event of death
—Expenses associated with the transfer of estate to survivors
— Money for replacing the services (such as homemaking) the
client provided to his or her family
— Income taxes the surviving spouse may pay when filing as a
single head of household
—Loss of the client’s private business valuation
```
```
Other insurable financial objectives include perpetual income
in the case of disability, coverage for catastrophic illness, and
protection against property loss and liability. While no one can
predict the future, many clients have lifestyle profiles that are
characterized by high personal or business risk. For more detailed
information on insurance planning, see Chapter 4.
◆ A client wants to protect capital accumulation. An invest-
ment plan must be structured to enable clients to meet financial
goals, given their tolerance for risk and discretionary spending.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
A client’s need for cash, market liquidity, and diversification also
affects portfolio construction. In addition to a medium- to long-
term investment strategy, clients should set aside cash for three to
six months’ household expenses as a hedge against unforeseen
financial events. Emergency funds serve as a cushion against job
loss or sudden catastrophic expenses. This strategy helps protect
clients from the need to spend down investment principal. See
Chapter 4 for more detail on investment planning.
◆ A client wants to minimize tax exposure. Reducing a client’s
tax burden can be accomplished through income and estate tax
planning. During a long-term relationship with a client, you can
build a financial plan to:
—Avoid or reduce taxes
—Shift the tax burden to family members in a lower tax bracket
—Allow wealth to accumulate while postponing taxation
—Take returns as capital gains by making lifetime gifts

In connection with a client’s expected life span (based upon
actuarial tables), you may be able to improve the tax situation for
the client’s family by providing for a will and through the transfer
of property by contract, operation of law, or disclaimer.
In summary, the planner assists the client in articulating short-
and long-term life goals and in establishing realistic and quan-
tifiable objectives. Since objectives are the central focus of the
financial planning process, it bears repeating that financial objec-
tives should be quantified in dollar amounts, time frames, and
risk assumptions instead of remaining general and open-ended.
A series of specific objectives are further defined by investment
_strategies_. Strategies are detailed optional programs for achieving
specific objectives. Strategies should compete for attention, mean-
ing that the best strategy to reach an objective will most closely
match the client’s predisposition to investment vehicles and risk.

THE FACT-FINDING SESSION:
GATHERING DATA TO HELP SOLVE CLIENT PROBLEMS
There are two types of data to gather from the client: quantitative
and qualitative. Quantitative information provides basic but specif-


```
Developing a Client Management System
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
ic identifying information concerning a family along with numeri-
cal details concerning the family’s financial status. It also provides
the basis for the many financial analyses you will perform.
Qualitative information provides general information concern-
ing a family’s goals, lifestyle, health status, risk tolerance level,
employment status, hobbies, attitudes, and fears. Qualitative data
give a financial plan life. Knowing a client’s specific goals, such as
planning to move when retiring at age fifty-five, funding a child’s
college education and expenses, starting an expensive hobby just
before retirement, or traveling extensively during retirement, is
important to the success of any financial planning.
◆ Examples of quantitative data include the following:
—General family profile
—Names, addresses, and phone numbers of family members
—Assets and liabilities
—Cash inflows and outflows
—Insurance policy information
—Employee benefit and pension plan information
—Tax returns for the last three years
—Details on current investments
—Retirement benefits available
—Client-owned business information
—Copies of wills and trusts
—Lifetime gifting programs
◆ Examples of qualitative data include the following:
—Goals and objectives
—Health status of client and family members
—Interests and hobbies
—Expectations about employment
—Risk tolerance level
—Anticipated changes in current/future lifestyle
—Other planning assumptions
```
```
After the interview concludes, set up the next appointment for
approximately four weeks after the data-gathering session. Before
you do any work, send the client a synopsis of the meeting, stating
your recollection of the issues and objectives you discussed and the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
conclusions to which you came. Ask the client to sign the synopsis
and return it to you. The synopsis should follow this outline:

```
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Client:
On November 3 you and I discussed... You had the following
concerns and objectives:... I provided you with an outline of how
I would approach your issues... If these responses meet your
recollection of the issues, please initial, date, and return a copy
of this letter to me by... Sincerely, Joseph Smith, CPA, CFP
```
This initiative ensures that you and the client are expecting
the same things from the work that is about to begin. It also limits

Step 3:
Putting It All Together
```
INTERPRET FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The information you have gathered by talking to a client and
reviewing his or her economic condition will lead you to reaching
conclusions about the client’s financial strengths and weaknesses.
Interpretation of financial information is where the science ends
and the art takes over. Here is where your experience with other
similar clients is applied. Your practice history kept in a case study
format will help you learn the do’s and don’ts of interpreting
financial information for financial planning. Take, for example,
a client’s insurance information:
◆ Life insurance
— Approximate need is roughly seven times gross earnings. Of
course, you will need to perform a needs analysis to determine
a more exact amount. You can do this by adding up all the
expenses that the client will be responsible for and arriving at
a total need.
— Primary beneficiary named. In the event of death of the insured,
this is the person who receives the insurance proceeds.

```
— Contingent beneficiary named. In the event of death of the
insured and primary beneficiary, this is the person who receives
the insurance proceeds.
— Disability waiver of premium included. In the event the insured
becomes disabled, this provision continues payment of the
insurance premium.
— Strength of issuing company. You undertake research to deter-
mine the strength of the insurance company that is under-
writing the policy.
◆ Disability insurance
— Approximate need is roughly 60 percent to 70 percent of
gross monthly earnings. Because of the extreme moral hazard
in providing an insured 100 percent benefits for not working,
insurance companies provide usually about two-thirds of the
earned income amount. Determine what the client’s earned
income is and use 60 to 70 percent of that amount as the dis-
ability benefit.
— Own occupation definition. If the insured becomes disabled
performing the duties of his or her specific occupation, the
insured may be able to receive benefits from his or her spe-
cific job and still work in a field outside the insured’s primary
occupation.
— Noncancelable and guaranteed renewable. As long as the
insured continues to pay the premium, the insurance company
cannot cancel the policy nor raise the premium on the insured.
However, the insurance company can raise the premium on an
entire classification of insureds.
— Partial and residual disability. If the insured is not totally dis-
abled, does he or she receive benefits while going back to work
part-time?
— Cost of living adjustment (COLA) rider. Do annual benefits
increase according to the increase in the consumer price index?
— Strength of issuing company. You undertake research to deter-
mine the strength of the insurance company that is underwrit-
ing the policy.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ Health insurance
— $1 million or higher lifetime catastrophic coverage. In the
event of serious illness, the insured needs plenty of coverage in
order to avoid catastrophes.
— Strength of issuing company. You undertake research to
determine the strength of the insurance company that is
underwriting the policy.
◆ Home owners insurance
— HO3 and HO15 coverage. Replacement cost coverage on
the client’s dwelling (HO3) and the contents (HO15) is neces-
sary.
— Riders on items not fully covered by policy. If your client has
a valuable item worth more than the underlying coverage
found inside the policy, the client needs to purchase a rider to
increase the limits. Items of this magnitude would include fur
coats, jewelry, and collectibles.
— Minimum $300,000 liability coverage. Having too little liability
coverage can prove extremely risky. In the event that someone
tries to sue the client, you want to ensure that your client’s per-
sonal assets are not at risk.
— Strength of issuing company. You undertake research to deter-
mine the strength of the insurance company that is underwrit-
ing the policy.
◆ Automobile insurance
— Minimum $300,000 liability coverage. Having too little or not
having any liability coverage can prove extremely risky. In the
event that someone tries to sue your client, you want to ensure
that your client’s personal assets are not at risk.
— Uninsured/underinsured coverage. This coverage enables your
client to increase liability coverage to the $300,000 amount in
the event someone gets into an accident with him or her and
has too little or no coverage.
— Physical damage coverage. This coverage protects your client
in the event his or her automobile gets into an accident with
another car or object and allows the client to restore the auto-
mobile to its condition prior to the accident.

```
REVIEW IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS
As personal financial planner to your client, you have every rea-
son to ask for full disclosure of pertinent information. You also
have the responsibility to ask the client if there are financial issues
you need to know in confidence. Among the legal documents that
may need your review are wills, trusts, buy-sell agreements, deeds,
divorce settlements, and any other legal claims on your client’s
assets. Other standard documents to be studied are investment
and retirement plans, the last three federal and state income tax
returns (since you can amend an income tax return up to three
years out), private notes payable and notes due, criminal records,
and court settlements. You need to know everything to help your
client and to protect yourself.
```
```
TIE CLIENT RESOURCES TO CLIENT OBJECTIVES
Your client’s assets and liabilities and other information pertain-
ing to financial stability or jeopardy must be organized in a series
of financial statements. This will enable you to determine the
strengths and weaknesses in the client’s financial position and eval-
uate the likelihood of your clients’ achieving their objectives in view
of available resources. It is important to stress the concept of avail-
able resources. A solid financial plan is based on predictions of growth
in current asset base and not on the best-case scenario, which might
include an estimate of future income or windfalls. For example,
the prudent financial planner will discount an inheritance in a
client’s financial plan. Relations between family members change.
Similarly, the deft financial planner will discount a client’s estimate
of future earning power. We all like to believe that we are worth
more than we are being paid. On the reverse side, a client’s liabili-
ties should be fully accounted, since liabilities are by definition
the worst-case scenario. Thus, an evaluation of the client’s current
economic condition adjusted for future capital accumulation and
liability is the basis upon which to build a financial plan.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
When analyzing the client’s financial and personal informa-
tion, do not lose sight of:
◆ Qualitative information that may help you understand client
motivation and personal traits predictive of future behavior. Is
your client a short-term thinker, spontaneous, impulsive? Is your
client conservative, indecisive, even timid? The plans you create for
clients must fit their personality and likely behavior in the future.
◆ Helping clients maintain control over their financial lives. You
may need to encourage, if not demand, that your client adopt a
budget and stick to it. A recalcitrant client is a failure in the mak-
ing and is bad advertising.
◆ Effect of unknown events. The financial plan you create for a
client is a fluid tool. It must be flexibly designed to accommodate
changing client goals, objectives, and strategies. The plan must
also anticipate the unknown: reversal of the stock market, sudden
illness, business failure, divorce, and death. These topics are very
unpleasant and even painful for some clients, but they must be
discussed and anticipated in the financial plan.
◆ Long-term effects of poor planning. What if your plan fails?
What is the client left with? You must talk to your client about
some residual capital and assets that will remain outside of the
financial plan. No planner is good enough to risk a client’s entire
basis of wealth in a financial plan. As a general rule, a client should
reserve enough liquidity to maintain a family for one year. Cer-
tain investments—401(k) plans and deferred income plans—are
untouchable and thus lie outside a self-directed financial plan.

CREATE CLIENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
From the information you have collected during the integrated
data-gathering step of PIPRIM, you should create two standard
financial statements to summarize the multiple dimensions of
a client’s financial condition. The first, a _Statement of Financial
Position,_ shows change in a client’s assets, liabilities, and net
worth over a three-to-five-year period. The second, a _Cash Flow
Statement,_ shows a client’s cash inflow less outflow at a point in
time, usually by quarter for the previous four quarters. Chapter 4
describes the cash flow management process in more detail.


```

```
Step 4:
Recommending Solutions
```
```
the next step in the client management system is to develop
recommendations (or strategies) to achieve a client’s financial
goals. These recommendations are solutions to a client’s goals
and priority objectives. Before you submit your recommendations
to a client in a formal proposal, do a test drive. Remember that
your recommendations are the financial plan the client has been
anticipating. It is the solution to a problem, the end point of a
long process of probing, information collecting, interpretation,
and synthesis. It has to be acceptable the first time. Often, your
recommendations will be fine-tuned before the client fully buys
in. This is to be encouraged.
It is advisable to test your general recommendations with the
client over an informal lunch or morning coffee. Let the client
give you direction among the options you have designed. This
puts the client’s fingerprints on the plan; it builds ownership
and commitment. Once you and the client agree on recom-
mendations, prepare a concise written proposal. The following
outline is a professional but easy-to-use format for a client’s
financial plan:
◆ An overview of the client’s short- and long-term goals
◆ The client’s current financial strengths and weaknesses and
implications for the financial plan
◆ The client’s financial objectives anchored to current resources
◆ A detailed summation of all recommendations, showing pluses
and minuses
◆ The financial plan from mutually selected recommendations
◆ A comprehensive economic overview of the client’s financial
plan, supported by financial statements
◆ A step-by-step implementation and monitoring plan
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
```
Step 5:
Implementing the Plan
```
you have tested your recommendations with the client over
lunch. You have agreed to a refinement of your recommenda-
tions. You have written and presented a final draft of the financial
plan to the client, and the client is delighted. You have at least
solved the client’s problem on paper. Now the really hard work
begins. It is time to turn recommendations into reality. The last
section of your final plan proposal is perhaps the most impor-
tant. It describes how you _and_ the client will work together to
implement the plan. The step-by-step blueprint must be specific.
It lays out in order the tasks, decisions, and assessments to be
made along the way to financial success. Talk to the client about
who will initiate action on each recommendation, and with what
results. EXHIBIT 3.5 (see page 92) is an outline of action for imple-
menting a financial plan.
If your compensation structure is fee-only, your involvement
in the actual implementation of the financial plan—that is,
selection of investment vehicles—will not be direct. In this
scenario, you will refer the client to an internal associate, stock-
broker, lawyer, or other financial product specialist. A special-
ist is a product salesperson or fee-based expert who works in
highly defined, technical financial areas, such as commodities or
futures for the risk-inclined client. Technical experts know their
fields very well and can suggest products tailored to the client’s
objectives, resources, and risk profile. You will want to review a
specialist’s proposal to make sure it fits your client’s needs and
other parts of the financial plan. Offer several specialists in the
same field to your client. This ensures your neutrality and places
some of the selection task on the client. Make sure the special-
ists’ perspective—aggressive or conservative—is compatible with
your own, or it may be difficult for the client to work with you
and the selected specialist.
If the client stops after step four of PIPRIM, short of implemen-
tation, then little good has been achieved. The client is no closer


```
Developing a Client Management System
```

```
to financial security, and you have likely received some payment
but have paid an opportunity cost. A client’s financial plan is
worthless on paper but potentially priceless in practice.
```
```
Step 6:
Monitoring the Plan
```
```
depending on your compensation model (see Chapter 6)—fully
paid on the delivery of the financial plan or commission on plan
performance—you will take a low or high profile in monitoring the
plan with the client. It is definitely to your benefit to show interest
even if your fee is fully paid. First, you will want to use all clients as
references. Second, financial and personal conditions change, and
you may be retained to do more work. Third, if you are a specialist
selling products, there is always the potential for second-genera-
tion sales. Fourth, you will want to know what strategies work and
why. This is your competitive advantage. In any event, schedule
periodic review sessions with each client to evaluate the course of
the financial plan. Plan to meet twice a year: in April after taxes,
and near the end of the year to evaluate forward strategies.
When you meet with clients to review progress, pay attention to
both personal and economic changes. Is the client getting mar-
ried or divorced, having children, moving to the suburbs, buying
a new car, or changing jobs? How has the plan been affected by
changes in federal tax laws, economic conditions, inflation, and
investment rate of return? Are new investment techniques avail-
able? If you drafted a plan for a client in the late 1970s, when
inflation stabilized at 12 percent per year, your strategies and
results would need to be completely different in today’s minimal-
inflation environment. Work with the client to modify the plan
as circumstances change. If necessary, return to the early stages
of the PIPRIM client management system to reevaluate goals and
collect new information in order to make plan adjustments that
fit a client’s changing needs.
A good model to use in monitoring a financial plan is to
start with the assumptions. When the plan was written, what
assumptions were made about the client’s financial condition
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
and personal situation and the general economy? How have
these assumptions changed in the last six to nine months? Are
the assumptions now more or less favorable? Do we expect the
new assumptions to prevail long enough to make changes to the
financial plan? If new assumptions can be expected to persist
with a good degree of probability (80 percent or more), then
adjusting the financial plan is warranted. Work with the client
closely to challenge the assumptions. Do not feel responsible if
the conditions you and the client predicted months ago have
changed. It is the nature of life. Do feel responsible for forcing
the client to face changing circumstances even if the realization
of personal issues is painful. Financial plans are not built on
emotion, they are built on facts.

Elements of a Personal Financial Plan

the piprim client management system is a systematic and logical
process designed to help clients reach their financial destination.
Beyond the six steps of PIPRIM there are three underlying values
that must be communicated to the client throughout the process.
First, a solid financial plan is built on _trust._ The client trusts the
planner’s experience, ethics, and analytical ability. The planner
trusts the client’s intentions and commitment to self-improve-
ment. Second, the financial plan is built on _change._ No final plan
is either permanent or perfect. The planner and client must be
committed to honest evaluation of changing conditions and to
continuing refinement of goals, objectives, and strategies. Both
parties must accept the inevitable ambiguities of change and its
impact on financial planning. Third, the financial plan is built
on _results_. A great plan on paper is not a plan; it is no more than
imagination. The planner and client must work together to put
a plan into action and to achieve success, which is the real payoff
for both of them.

financial planning—or personal financial planning

(PFP), as the field is also known—is more than just

investment planning. In fact, investment planning is

just one of the many disciplines involved in comprehen-

sive financial planning, although clients often tend to

equate the two. It is crucial to educate clients so that they

understand that financial planning involves a variety of

disciplines, each necessary in the process of integrat-

ing all of a client’s needs and concerns into a cohesive for-
mat. Taking a comprehensive approach is the only way clients
can know where they stand vis-à-vis their short- and long-term
objectives.

PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING DEFINED
Personal financial planning is the process of determining whether
and how an individual can meet life goals through proper
management of financial resources. It is the development and
implementation of an integrated, coordinated plan for achieving
overall financial objectives.
As noted in Chapter 3, financial planning is a process, not a
product. It may lead to recommendation of a product, but finan-
cial planners are not order-takers. Instead, planners help people
achieve their financial objectives by constructing a complete,
comprehensive plan that addresses all client concerns.

WHY CLIENTS DO NOT PLAN
There are many reasons why clients may not undertake financial
planning on their own, including the following:
◆ Thinking they have insufficient assets or income to warrant
planning
◆ Assuming their financial situation is in good order
◆ Putting off what is complex and worrisome
◆ Not wanting to consider unpleasant events, such as death, dis-
ability, unemployment, or property loss
◆ Thinking financial planning is expensive

All of these assumptions are faulty. Of course, failing to plan
ahead also costs money. The consequences of not planning
include the following:
◆ Inadequate protection against personal catastrophes such as
death, disability, serious illness, an automobile accident, pro-
longed unemployment, or other major negative events
◆ Too little money set aside for retirement or for the family’s
educational needs
◆ Higher than necessary income or gift taxation


```

◆ Unplanned estates, with higher taxes and settlement costs
◆ Not reaching financial goals in life
```
```
WHY YOUR CLIENT NEEDS YOUR HELP
Many people have inadequate skills in making informed, system-
atic decisions about their own finances. They have little exposure
to good decision-making models. Planners help clients iden-
tify needs and good ways to meet them while avoiding potential
obstacles. The planner’s job incorporates elements of counseling,
information management and processing, education planning,
investment planning, income tax planning, risk management,
retirement planning, and estate planning.
```
```
CORE DISCIPLINES OF PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING
Financial planning consists of the following core disciplines:
◆ Cash flow management
◆ Insurance planning
◆ Investment planning
◆ Education planning
◆ Income tax planning
◆ Retirement planning
◆ Estate planning
```
```
This chapter provides a framework for deciding in which disci-
pline or combination of disciplines you should focus your practice.
```
```
Cash Flow Management
clients seek cash flow management services to obtain more effec-
tive control of their financial situation. For many, that means learn-
ing to manage their monthly cash flow better. Often, clients would
like to save a larger portion of their income while maintaining their
lifestyle. Some have critical cash flow problems, such as excessive
debt, little or no savings, or significant fluctuations in cash inflow.
Others are concerned about having sufficient resources to fund
retirement and seek to control their spending in order to avoid
consuming assets too fast. Therefore, these clients have financial
objectives that relate specifically to cash flow management.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Cash flow management has two chief purposes:
1 Management of income and expenditures, including establish-
ing and maintaining a reserve of cash or near-cash equivalents to
meet unanticipated or emergency needs, such as those caused by
illness, injury, death, or sudden loss of employment; and
2 Systematic creation and maintenance of a surplus of cash for
capital investment.

Planners sometimes underestimate the importance of cash flow
management as a service to provide to clients. This is a mistake,
because solving problems in this area can play a significant role in
the client’s ability to reach a wide range of financial goals.
The three primary components of cash flow management are
budgeting, cash flow planning, and determination of net worth.
Without the planner’s help in these areas, clients will have diffi-
culty accomplishing their goals.

YOUR ROLE IN CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT
As a planner your role is to assist the client in developing a cash
flow plan. This process involves compiling financial information,
identifying income sources and spending patterns, establishing
reasonable objectives, developing a budget, and monitoring
performance. Cash flow planning can have a significant effect on
a client’s lifestyle, and the planner frequently needs to educate
the client about the importance of saving money. As part of this
process, the planner must help the client assess which goals are
realistic, given the client’s current level of saving, and how much
more money would be needed to reach goals that appear impos-
sible now. Thus, a planner’s key aim often is to help clients set up
a cash flow system that generates an appropriate level of savings. If
clients still are unable to save enough, the planner needs to help
them revise their objectives to a level they can attain.

BUDGETING AND BUDGET ANALYSIS
Budgeting is a time-consuming yet essential task; it requires a
comprehensive analysis of how fast clients are spending and
whether and at what rate they are investing toward short- and


```
The Spectrum of Financial Planning
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
long-range goals. To manage their money effectively, clients need
to learn how to plan their budgets from the bottom up. Clients
must project income, document and monitor spending and
investing, and compare projected and actual figures. The task can
be accomplished only if the client maintains accurate, detailed
accounts of income and spending patterns. That may sound more
difficult than it is, however. Budget-related data can be retrieved
from income tax returns, home improvement records, bank and
brokerage statements, financial statements (such as the balance
sheet and income statement), insurance policies, retirement and
Social Security information, pension benefits, and credit card and
checkbook records.
Successful budgeting usually means controlling spending. The
planner must make realistic estimates of how much clients will
spend. If that number is likely to exceed income, the planner
should help clients reduce or eliminate expenditures. In addi-
tion, he or she should review the budget periodically and make
adjustments based on what has or has not worked in the past.
If a client is burdened with excessive debt, has marginal suc-
cess in controlling spending, or presents a complicated situation
that is beyond the capacity of the planner to handle, then the
planner should consider referring the client to a financial coun-
seling service.
Preparing personal budgets and performing analysis require
three steps:
Step 1: Establishing reasonable goals and objectives
Step 2: Determining the client’s current financial situation
Step 3: Forecasting future expenses and income
```
```
The first step is to help clients establish reasonable goals and
objectives. Long-range goals might center on retirement and edu-
cation needs, while a short-term goal might be to improve cash
flow. When clients understand their objectives and establish that
they are realistic, they are in a better position to determine whether
their current spending patterns will help get them there.
The second step is to determine the client’s current financial
situation by analyzing expenses and income flows over the last six
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
months to see what regular and lump sum costs the client has. Use
old cash receipts, checks and check registers, and charge accounts
to organize expenses by category. One technique is to have cli-
ents list expenses in a notebook divided into twelve sections, one
for each month, with each section further subdivided into types
of expense categories. Distinguish between fixed and variable
expenses, for example. The former are defined as necessities—that
is, rent, mortgage, food, clothing, automobile payments, insurance,
utilities, taxes, loans, and charge account balances—over which the
client has little control. Variable expenses, on the other hand, are
more discretionary in nature and often can be modified or even
postponed, if necessary. Note items that have tax implications, such
as mortgage interest, real estate taxes, and charitable contributions.
The process of recording all expenses may have the positive effect
of discouraging clients from unnecessary spending.
If you are providing this service for a special purpose, such as
in connection with a client’s qualifying for a loan, you will need
to select the appropriate budget forms. Banks and other financial
institutions may require use of special forms. Clients may want to
adopt such forms for their ongoing budget planning, especially if
they do a lot of business with a specific bank.
The third step is to help clients realistically forecast future
monthly revenue from salary, business income, interest, divi-
dends, and personal loans as well as disposable income after taxes
(including costs of medical insurance and other payroll deduc-
tions). Identify every income source a client has, and verify each
source from past income tax returns. Once you have estimated
income and expenses for each month, ask the client to predict
expenses for the entire year.
Aim to balance income with expenses in each category. Irregular
expenditures such as vacations and holiday gifts should be spread
over the entire year. Mark the client’s calendar with the dates that
large expenditures are due. Compare actual and planned spending
on a monthly basis. If significant variances exist, go to the budgeted
items and rework them with flagged queries and recommenda-
tions to determine where the client might reduce costs while pre-
serving as much as possible of the desired discretionary outlays.


```

```

```
Use current fixed and variable expenses as the basis for making
a three-to-five-year projection of these expenditures. Remember
to allow for an emergency fund to be set aside in a money market
account (equaling six months’ worth of gross living expenses),
and take inflation, tax rates, salary changes, and other variable
factors into account. Expenses will change, too, if clients care for
aging parents, pay college fees, have children, buy a new car or
home, or otherwise alter their circumstances. Remind clients that
these changes may affect their ability to meet long-term goals.
EXHIBIT 4.1 (see page 142) presents a sample work sheet for prepar-
ing a monthly budget.
```
```
CASH FLOW PLANNING
Once you have analyzed your client’s cash flow, the next step is to
help the client maximize discretionary income by implementing
specific strategies. To do this, you will need to help clients control
spending, adjust their goals if they cannot save enough money to
reach their initial objectives, and periodically revisit their projected
and actual cash flows to make sure they are staying on track.
There are a variety of tools at your disposal to help clients
increase their discretionary income. They include the following:
debt restructuring, asset reallocation, qualified plan vehicles,
employee benefit plans, and separate treatment of children’s
assets.
◆ Debt restructuring. Clients may be able to pay off all outstand-
ing credit card balances by consolidating debt into one personal
bank loan or mortgage. The planner should recommend that
they then stop using their credit cards as much as is practical.
◆ Asset reallocation. This technique involves moving money
to make it work harder. The planner may recommend moving
underperforming assets into more productive investments that
are still in line with the client’s goals and time frames. Or the plan-
ner might suggest substituting growth investments for income-
producing ones and taxable investments for tax-exempt ones.
◆ Qualified plans and other personal retirement account (before-
tax) vehicles. Clients should use tax-deferred savings plans—
including 401(k) plans, tax-deferred annuities, Keogh plans,
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
other employer-sponsored plans, IRAs, and deferred compen-
sation plans—as much as possible. If the client is saving for
retirement outside of a qualified plan, such as in an after-tax
investment account, the planner should illustrate the long-term
benefits of tax-deferred savings, since taxes are not paid annu-
ally. Incidentally, qualified plans need not consist of only 401(k)
plans. Self-employed clients can invest in a Keogh or a simplified
employer-sponsored plan as well. Also, IRAs, deferred compensa-
tion plans, and nonqualified savings plans might be available to
both employer-employed and self-employed clients.
◆ Employee benefit plans. The client’s employee benefit plans
can pay for some expenses with pretax dollars. Clients whose
employers offer such plans can use a 401(k), 403(b), SEP, or
flexible spending account to pay allowable child care or medical
expenses, for example, thereby minimizing taxes.
◆ Separate treatment of children’s assets. Planners can encour-
age clients to save for a child in a custodial account or trust. The
marginal tax bracket applicable to the taxable investment earnings
is likely to be lower for the child than it would be for the parent.

DETERMINING NET WORTH
In addition to determining appropriate budgets and the cash
flow that can be saved and invested from future earnings, you
also need to know where your clients stand today—their overall
financial standing, or net worth. In simplest terms, net worth con-
stitutes assets (items you own) less liabilities (amounts you owe).
In determining net worth, the financial planner does much more
than merely constructing and reviewing a net worth statement.
The process, to be most beneficial, involves calculating current
net worth, setting a realistic goal for the upcoming year, and
developing specific strategies for meeting that goal. Planning
efforts that focus on net worth help clients to do the following:
(1) establish financial discipline, (2) organize financial life
around a future target, (3) measure financial progress on a regu-
lar basis, and (4) feel financially secure about the future.
◆ The basic calculation. The planning begins with calculating
a client’s net worth. Net worth, the basic measure of financial


```

```
health, is the total fair-market value of all assets owned, such as
real estate and stocks, bonds, and other securities, minus all out-
standing liabilities, such as mortgages and revolving-credit loans.
Thus, net worth is the amount by which assets exceed liabilities at
a specific point in time.
To calculate net worth, pull together the relevant financial
records. These include the latest tax records, bank statements,
canceled checks, credit card information, other itemized living
expenses, brokerage accounts and mutual fund records, mort-
gage payments, real estate closing records, insurance policies,
pension account records, and loan repayment schedules. Gath-
ering all this information may seem daunting, but it is essential
for net worth planning. The data in these documents also lay the
foundation for other planning areas.
The planner should analyze the information by categorizing
assets as liquid, investment, or personal. Further classify invest-
ment assets as short term or long term. Label long-term assets
as equity, debt, or miscellaneous, and categorize liabilities as
short term or long term. Subtracting total liabilities from total
assets then provides the net worth figure for the family as of a
given date.
◆ Forming a strategy. The net worth figure is the basis for an
appropriate net worth planning strategy. If net worth is negative,
which is not only possible but in some cases quite likely, it does
not necessarily mean that the family is on the verge of declar-
ing bankruptcy. It does mean, however, that the planner should
develop aggressive strategies for debt reduction, higher invest-
ment return, and realistic goal-setting.
Just as a negative net worth does not necessarily point toward
impending disaster, a positive net worth does not mean the finan-
cial planning process is over. Net worth should be viewed yearly,
generally with a new target set for saving in the coming year. If
the client meets or exceeds that goal, the planner should take
steps to preserve or increase the rate of saving. If the client falls
short, however, the planner should either develop new strategies
for correcting the situation or help the client set a more realistic
net worth goal.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
To increase net worth, clients must spend less and save more.
It is that simple, and the planner cannot emphasize this point too
strongly. An inability to control spending is the root cause of most
personal financial disasters, well ahead of inadequate income,
unwise investments, and catastrophic changes in circumstances.
EXHIBIT 4.2 (see page 143) is a work sheet that can be used in cal-
culating net worth.

INTEGRATION OF CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT WITH
FINANCIAL PLANNING DISCIPLINES
Once your clients have planned to maximize income and minimize
spending, they also will need your help to plan for insurance, invest-
ment, education, income tax, retirement, and their estate.
Because cash flow management is the means for funding client
goals in other planning areas, generally it is the starting point of
the planning process. The chart at right describes integration of
cash flow management with other key planning disciplines.

Insurance Planning

purchasing insurance is the most common way of handling
various risks that can cause financial loss. In order to reduce
these risks, people must seek to minimize or eliminate hazard-
ous elements that can increase the chances of harm, injury, dan-
ger, or destruction. Insurance accomplishes this in two ways: it
transfers or shifts risk from an individual to a group, and it pays
for losses.
Clients buy insurance to provide themselves with the funds nec-
essary, for example, to maintain their existing lifestyle after the
death of a loved one (life insurance), to replace earned income
(disability insurance), to pay medical bills (health insurance), or
to replace or repair a tangible item (home owners and automo-
bile insurance). If a client cannot write a check to cover a loss, it
is time to buy insurance.
Your job is to help clients identify the risks that can keep them
from attaining their personal financial goals and construct a plan
of action to provide adequate insurance against those risks. The
information from the client’s comprehensive financial plan,

including lists of assets and liabilities, cash flow sources, and
objectives, can be used to develop and implement an appropriate
insurance program for the client.
The financial planner typically focuses on estimating how much
insurance the client needs and determining what type of policy is
best. Insurance contracts can be confusing, and your specialized
knowledge can greatly help your clients.
Insurance can be broken into two subcategories: life and
health, and property and casualty.

LIFE INSURANCE
Life insurance policies require that a policy owner, who may or
may not be the person insured, invest money with an insurance
company that has agreed to pay money to a beneficiary on the
insured’s death. The need for life insurance can come from
either business or personal relationships.
The rules for life insurance are quite simple. The primary
objective is to buy enough life insurance for the beneficiary to
keep the same lifestyle that existed before the insured person
died. Life insurance can also be used as a form of forced savings,
since several types of policies accumulate cash value.
How much life insurance does the client need? The financial
planner needs to determine what the economic loss would be if
the insured person died. EXHIBIT 4.3 (see pages 144–147) presents
a work sheet that can be used to estimate the client’s life insur-
ance needs. Once that need is determined, the next critical step is
to determine the resources the client has to expend on this neces-
sity. Based on that response, the planner determines what types of
policies are affordable. The planner discusses the merits of these
policies with the client, who can then choose one.
◆ Term insurance is temporary insurance designed for a speci-
fied period of time, such as one year, five years, or ten years, or
to a specified age, such as age sixty-five. At the end of the speci-
fied period, the contract expires. Good term policies have two
key features: _guaranteed renewability,_ which means that as long as
the client pays the premiums, the insured does not have to fur-
nish evidence of insurability; and _convertibility,_ which means that


```
The Spectrum of Financial Planning
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
the term policy can be converted to one with cash value, such as
whole life, during the term of the contract.
Term insurance policies are appropriate for policy owners
who have a short-term insurance need, generally of fourteen
years or less.
◆ Whole life insurance policies have level premium payments and
are designed to remain in force over the insured person’s entire
lifetime. Premium payments during the early years are deliber-
ately higher than would be required to cover the probability of
death alone. This excess charge in the early years is invested in
long-term bonds and mortgages, allowing the policy to build cash
value. That cash value is then used to pay the cost of insurance in
the policy’s later years, when the insured is older and more likely
to die. The cash value and/or dividends may offset some or all of
the premiums as they build.
The policy owner can also access that cash value by borrowing it
from the insurer or surrendering the policy. The cash value of a sur-
rendered policy may be taxable. Policy interest rates are generally
low, and premiums are paid for the insured person’s entire lifetime
or until age one hundred, when the policy usually matures. The
maturity date depends on state law and the insurance company’s
rules. At death, the death benefit is payable to a designated benefi-
ciary or to the state if no beneficiary is identified.
Whole life policies are appropriate for clients who want to shift
the investment burden over to the insurance company and who
like fixed-income investing.
◆ Universal life insurance is a type of cash-value policy. It pro-
vides flexible premiums and flexible benefits; its interest rate is
tied to those of short-term money market accounts. These policies
separately disclose the operating expenses and mortality charges
paid by the policy owner. As with all cash-value policies, universal
life policies let policyholders access cash value through loans or
by surrendering the policy.
The first year’s premium is the only required premium under a
universal life policy. After the first policy year, the policy owner is
free to raise, lower, or even skip premium payments as desired, as
long as there is enough cash in the policy to keep it in force. An
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
upper limit on premiums in universal life policies is established by
the IRS under Code Section 7702. The lower limit on premiums
is the cost of the term insurance that the policy must have to keep
it in force.
Universal life policies come with two death benefit options.
Option 1 provides a death benefit equal to the face amount.
Option 2 provides a death benefit equal to the policy’s cash value
plus the face amount. The premium is usually the same under
each option. However, because the death benefit is increasing at
a faster rate under option 2, less funds are available to keep in the
cash-value account. Option 1 will therefore have more cash value
than option 2 and will allow the policy to last longer. Option 1
generally works better for individuals age fifty and over because
of the increased mortality charges under option 2.
Universal life policies are appropriate for clients who want the
flexibility to increase or decrease premiums and who want their
investments tied to short-term money market rates.
◆ Variable life insurance is similar to whole life insurance in
that it has fixed premiums and a minimum guaranteed death
benefit. The difference is that the investment risk and return are
shifted to the policy owner. The policy owner directs the funds
backing the policy into one or more of a group of segregated
investment accounts chosen by the life insurance company. The
policy owner can allocate assets among a stock fund, a bond
fund, and a money market fund. Because the policy owner picks
the portfolio of investments, there is no minimum cash value
guarantee.
When the portfolio performs well, both the cash value and the
death benefit of a variable life policy increase accordingly. When
the portfolio’s performance is below expectations, the death
benefit may drop, but if the owner maintains premium payments,
the death benefit will never drop below the amount of coverage
agreed to when the policy was issued. Variable life policies are
suitable for clients who want to choose how the portfolio backing
the life insurance policy is invested and who are willing to assume
the investment risk that goes with that responsibility.

DISABILITY INSURANCE
Disability income insurance is a form of health insurance that
replaces a percentage of income lost due to a physical or mental
incapacity. Clients need disability income insurance whenever
ongoing living and medical expenses might exceed income from
investments, a spouse’s income, and existing earned-income-
replacement provisions. Most clients need disability income insur-
ance—fewer than one in six consumers typically have adequate
protection.
The most important point to consider when purchasing a new
disability policy can be found in the definition. The best type of
policy to purchase is one that’s defined as “own occupation,”
or “own occ” for short. With this type of policy, if the insured is
unable to perform the specific duties and responsibilities of his
regular job, then he can collect benefits regardless of whether or
not he decides to go back to work at a different job. The alterna-
tive definition, “any occupation” (or “any occ” for short), means
that if you are capable of re-entering the workforce, the insur-
ance company—if it feels that your disability will ultimately not
affect your ability to earn a living—can decide to reduce, or in
some cases, even eliminate, your benefit. Then there is a middle
ground called “split definition,” which provides the favorable
“own occ” definition of coverage for a limited period of time and
the “any occ” definition thereafter.
Other terms to look for include “noncancelable,” which means
the insurance company cannot cancel the policy as long as you
continue to pay the premiums; and “guaranteed renewable,”
which means the insurance company cannot raise your premiums
as an individual insured, although it reserves the right to raise
premiums for an entire classification of insureds, such as teachers
or forty-year-old females.
```
```
PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE
Anyone who cannot or does not want to have to write a check to
replace or repair a home, automobile, or other property needs
property and casualty insurance, which usually consists of home
owners, automobile, and umbrella (liability) insurance.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ Home owners insurance covers a variety of risks, including
physical property damage and personal property theft. It also
covers compensation for loss of use if clients need to move out of
their home temporarily, as well as public liability protection if an
accident occurs on their premises.
For home owners, the best type of insurance is HO3 coverage,
or all-risk (open peril) coverage. This type of policy provides
replacement-cost coverage on the dwelling itself for any peril
except for those specifically excluded by the policy. An HO15
policy provides full replacement cost (up to policy limits) on a
home’s contents. For renters, an HO4 policy provides replace-
ment-cost coverage on the home’s contents. For condominium
and co-op owners, an HO6 policy provides replacement-cost cov-
erage and covers the insured for damage to interior walls. Finally,
for home owners with older homes, an HO8 policy covers them
only at actual cash value, which is replacement cost less depre-
ciation. Full replacement coverage on an older house (usually
pre–World War II) is usually very expensive, if available at all. If
you have upgraded your older house, such as redoing the electric
wiring, heating, or plumbing, then you would probably qualify for
the better HO3 coverage.
◆ Automobile insurance covers both personal injury and prop-
erty damage. It has two major components. First, liability cover-
age provides protection against personal injury to others. That
includes pain and suffering, protection of passengers against
uninsured and underinsured motorists, lost wages, and medical
expenses. Second, property damage or collision insurance also
provides protection for any property damaged by the insured.
Most states require evidence of insurance for an individual
to register an automobile. These minimum or statutory require-
ments for the amount of insurance necessary for bodily injury
or property damage are almost always inadequate. An appropri-
ate amount of coverage for bodily injury or property damage is
$300,000.
◆ Liability insurance. Many times the underlying liability cover-
age found in a home owners or automobile policy is inadequate.
People have assets well beyond those covered under these poli-

cies. To protect yourself from lawsuits that can eat away at your
personal assets, liability coverage, such as an umbrella policy, is
warranted. These policies are relatively inexpensive, such as $175
for $1 million worth of coverage, and kick in only after the liabil-
ity limits from the home owners or automobile policy have been
reached. Premium discounts exist for coverage purchased above
$1 million.

Investment Planning
investment planning is critical for helping clients reach their
financial goals. There is no one right way to invest—the right way
is the one that works for the client. Your job is to discover what
that method might be.
There are three principal steps in the investment planning pro-
cess: first, defining investment parameters; second, managing client
expectations; and third, selecting appropriate investment vehicles.
```
```
DEFINING INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
The financial planner must perform an assessment of six overall
investment parameters for the client: risk tolerance level, time
horizon, liquidity concerns, marketability concerns, income tax
consequences, and diversification concerns.
1 Risk tolerance level. Clients generally are not risk averse; they
are loss averse. They want to earn high rates of return without
losing principal. Risk tolerance is a measure of how much risk
someone is willing to take in purchasing an investment. A client’s
tolerance for risk determines which investments are appropriate
for that client, and those investments in turn determine whether
clients reach their objectives. To assess clients’ risk tolerance,
ask them to complete the Client Risk-Tolerance Questionnaire,
which appears as EXHIBIT 4.4 (see pages 148–152), and then you
complete the accompanying Client Score Sheet.
2 Time horizon. A client’s investment time horizon is the amount
of time available to attain a financial objective. The time horizon
affects the investment vehicles used to attain the goal. For exam-
ple, if the client has a high-priority goal with an extremely short
time horizon, a low-risk money market instrument (such as a U.S.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Treasury bill, money market fund, or short-term certificate of
deposit) may be a suitable investment vehicle. If the time horizon
is ten years or more, an illiquid investment (such as real estate)
that has a higher expected rate of return may be suitable. A con-
sideration related to time horizon is the degree of volatility that
investment carries. The longer the time horizon, the less concern
there is about an investment’s short-term volatility.
3 Liquidity. Clients with limited investments or those saving for a
particular personal or business expenditure, such as a down pay-
ment on a home, will be concerned about investment liquidity,
or their ability to convert an investment into cash without losing
a significant part of their principal. Liquid investments include
short-term government securities, money market funds, and sav-
ings accounts.
4 Marketability. Marketability and liquidity are often confused.
Marketability is the speed and ease with which a security can be
bought or sold. Investments such as real estate can have high mar-
ketability but may not be liquid, especially during slow markets,
because significant principal would be lost in a sale under those
conditions.
5 Income tax considerations. Investment selection is influenced
by a client’s tax bracket, available tax credits, and amounts and
types of income, deductions, and depreciation. The return on
an investment is a combination of the tax benefits, the type and
amount of cash flow, and the type and amount of final distribu-
tions. Certain investments make more sense for high-income cli-
ents, whereas others are more appropriate for clients with lower
incomes. High-tax-bracket clients generally benefit more from
tax-free, tax-sheltered, and tax-deferred income. To see which
investments will provide a higher rate of return for a particular cli-
ent, you must compare the after-tax returns of those investments.
Never make an investment solely for the income tax benefits with-
out also weighing the investment return.
6 Diversification. The old adage “Don’t keep all your eggs in
one basket” holds true for investing. To maximize returns and
minimize risk, it is a good idea to spread risk among different
instruments and asset classes—such as allocations among blue-

```
chip stocks, Treasury bills, municipal bonds, small-cap stocks, and
money market funds—rather than putting 100 percent of invest-
ment money in any one of these categories.
```
```
MANAGING CLIENT EXPECTATIONS
Once the financial planner understands client concerns, he or she
needs to help clients feel comfortable with investing and under-
stand what it can and cannot do for them. It is important to explain
key concepts such as the types of risk investors are exposed to, rates
of return, and the risk/return trade-off present in investing.
Risk comes in two forms: systematic and unsystematic.
1 Systematic risk stays with you as long as you are an investor
in the marketplace, and you cannot reduce or eliminate it. In
assuming this risk, you gain the potential that the market will
reward you. Systematic risk can be divided into the following
three types:
— market risk, or the risk present merely by virtue of being in the
marketplace;
— interest rate risk, or the risk that changes in interest rates will
adversely affect stock and bond prices; and
— purchasing power risk, or the risk that inflation will adversely
affect stock and bond prices.
2 Unsystematic risk can be controlled through diversification
and includes the following two types:
— business risk, which is based on the particular sector of the mar-
ketplace in which one is investing; and
— financial risk, which is based on debt levels incurred by a com-
pany in which one is invested.
```
```
Return is typically referred to in three forms: expected, mini-
mum required, and actual.
1 Expected return is what you would normally expect to earn
in the future from a particular investment. It is based on antic-
ipated growth, earnings, or income generated by the invest-
ment. Expected return is directly correlated to the amount of
risk an investment vehicle carries, which in turn is related to
the particular asset class of the investment. Equity issues, for
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
example, are often classified as one of four classes, based on
the value of the company assets, as shown in the table above.
According to the Chicago-based Ibbotson Associates, which
tracks returns of asset classes in its annual handbook, _Stocks, Bonds,
Bills, and Inflation,_ from 1925 to 2003 small-cap stocks returned
12.7 percent, followed by large-cap stocks at 10.4 percent, long-
term government bonds at 5.4 percent, and Treasury bills at 3.7
percent. During this period, inflation averaged 3 percent.
2 Minimum required rate of return refers to the return an invest-
ment needs to earn in order to warrant its purchase. Before you
invest any money, calculate an acceptable rate of return that will
allow the client to achieve the set objectives.
3 Actual return refers to the real return you earn by holding a
particular investment. The return consists of interest, dividends,
and the investment’s price appreciation.

SELECTING APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT VEHICLES
The financial planner must help the client objectively determine
investment strategies for achieving financial goals. In selecting
investment vehicles, investors essentially have two options: becom-
ing owners or lenders. Owners hold interests in equity instruments,
such as stocks; in real estate; or in commodities, such as gold.
Lenders invest in bonds and other fixed-income instruments.

INVESTMENT TYPES
◆ Money market instruments are generally the safest but provide
the lowest returns. Examples include U.S. Treasury bills, commer-
cial paper, and certificates of deposit.

```
STOCK ASSET CLASS MARKET CAPITALIZATION RANGE
```
```
Large capitalization (large cap) More than $5 billion
Midcapitalization (midcap) $1 billion–$5 billion
Small capitalization (small cap) $300 million–$1 billion
Microcapitalization (microcap) $10 million–$300 million
```

```
The Spectrum of Financial Planning
```

```
◆ Fixed-income investments can be broken down into three
categories: (1) U.S. government obligations, which consist of
Series EE and HH bonds, U.S. Treasury notes (with one- to ten-
year maturities), and bonds (with ten- to thirty-year maturities);
(2) municipal obligations (general obligation bonds backed
by the credit of the local taxing authority) and revenue bonds
(backed by the earning capability of the specific project); and
(3) corporate bonds (issued by corporations to raise money).
```
```
EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Key categories of equity securities include blue-chip, income,
growth, cyclical, defensive, and interest-sensitive stocks.
◆ Blue-chip stocks are stocks of highly regarded and well-
established companies. They generally pay dividends in good and
bad years. Examples include IBM, Merck, and McDonald’s.
◆ Income stocks are those such as utility stocks that pay divi-
dends.
◆ Growth stocks are from corporations with increasing profits
that reinvest a large percentage of their earnings to achieve con-
tinued expansion. Growth stocks are expected to increase in value
faster than the market average.
◆ Cyclical stocks are from companies that tend to prosper in
growing economies and do poorly during down cycles. Examples
include industries such as airlines, automobiles, and steel.
◆ Defensive stocks are relatively unaffected by general fluctua-
tions in the economy because their companies produce necessi-
ties: “eat-’em, drink-’em, and smoke-’em” products like groceries,
beverages, and tobacco.
◆ Interest-sensitive stocks rise and fall with changes in inter-
est rates. Examples include stocks in the housing and banking
industries.
```
```
MUTUAL FUNDS
An alternative to purchasing individual securities is investing in
mutual funds. A mutual fund invests in cash, bonds, stocks, or
other investments. The purchasers of the fund’s shares essentially
own a portion of each investment owned by the fund.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
For diversification purposes, mutual funds can be an appropri-
ate investment vehicle for small to medium portfolios. If an inves-
tor cannot afford to purchase one hundred shares of fifty differ-
ent stocks, he or she may be able to afford one hundred shares of
a mutual fund that invests in those same fifty stocks. The investor’s
shares are pooled with those of other investors, enabling the pool
to invest in more securities than might otherwise be feasible.
Among other advantages of mutual funds is the fact that pro-
fessional managers oversee the portfolios, using their expertise to
maximize returns. Mutual funds are liquid, meaning that inves-
tors can cash out at will. Investors can purchase over time in small
increments, as low as $50 per month. Mutual funds may also offer
dividend reinvestment plans, periodic withdrawal and investment
plans, check-writing privileges, and investor services via the tele-
phone and Internet.

INSURANCE INVESTMENTS
Cash-value life insurance policies provide an investment alterna-
tive. See the preceding discussion of this category in the Insur-
ance Planning section of this chapter.

SELECTING A BROKER-DEALER
Financial advisers who sell investment products usually work with
a broker-dealer (BD). Affiliation with a broker-dealer opens up a
vast network of relationships with mutual fund companies; insur-
ance companies; clearing firms; training firms; and experts on
taxation, retirement plans, financial plans, and other relevant
areas. However, be aware that advisers can be affiliated with only
one broker-dealer at a time.
Advisers who are just starting out should not expect BDs to
actively recruit them. They tend to look for proven producers,
so few consider beginners. However, most will still welcome a
serious candidate who is committed to financial planning.
Ultimately, the decision comes down to which broker-dealer
the adviser feels comfortable working with for both the present
and the long term. A way to start would be for the adviser to ask
colleagues which broker-dealer firms they use and why. The next


```

```
step would be to narrow the list down to three and visit each. The
planner should insist on talking with the people with whom he or
she would have the most contact, for example, the branch man-
ager, the person who processes trades or pays commissions, or the
individual responsible for record keeping.
Here is a partial list of topics to explore when inquiring about
the services of a broker-dealer:
◆ Training programs for advisers
◆ Research services used by the BD
◆ Research tools available to advisers
◆ Certification requirements for advisers (e.g., RIA)
◆ Financial condition of the BD
◆ Products offered for fee-based advisers
◆ Capabilities of servicing client accounts
◆ Payout rates on investments sold
◆ Errors and omissions liability coverage
◆ Back-office operations: frequency and manner of billing, whether
certain assets can be excluded from billing, costs to advisers
◆ Clearing firm used
◆ Adviser marketing support
◆ Capacity for identifying adviser on client account statements
```
```
Education Planning
with tuition costs spiraling upward faster than inflation, it
is critical that clients plan early for the cost of their children’s
education. Because many clients are having children later in life,
planning for education can directly conflict with planning for
retirement. Funds for both may be needed at the same time.
The financial planner needs to educate clients about the ris-
ing costs associated with education and the urgency to begin
planning sooner rather than later. During early discussions the
planner should carefully review with clients the hierarchy of
options that exist for paying for college. Parents should look
into grants and scholarships first, followed by financial aid, then
loans, and lastly their own personal resources.
Another approach is to look to grandparents who are trying to
liquidate their estates. Direct gifts covering tuition payments to
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
schools, colleges, and universities can be made without interfer-
ing with the annual gift-tax exclusion (for more on this topic, see
the Estate Planning section in this chapter).
Planners must ensure that the client funds “through” college
and not just “to” college. In other words, if the student takes five
years to complete college and graduates at age twenty-three, plan-
ning should be done through age twenty-three, not just through
age eighteen.
Planners who provide college-education planning to their
clients should use the following nine-step process, adapted from
_A Professional’s Guide to College Planning,_ by Raymond D. Loewe,
CLU, ChFC, National Underwriter Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio.
1 Learn the basics.
2 Help your clients complete a trial financial aid test.
3 Help your clients construct a college budget based on the
adequacy of their retirement plan.
4 Teach your clients and their children how to select the proper
colleges.
5 Plan the financial aid strategy while the student is still in high
school.
6 Fill out financial aid forms correctly.
7 Compare and evaluate every financial aid award.
8 Integrate any college-borrowing plan into a retirement plan.
9 Help clients to save, save, save—the right way.

◆ Learn the basics. You will be asked many questions by clients
pertaining to their children’s education plans. You may want to
develop answers to common, basic questions, such as:
— How much is college going to cost (including room, board,
tuition, fees, books, travel expenses, laundry money, etc.)?
—What are the four types of financial aid?
—How does financial aid work?
— How can students find the best college within an acceptable
price range?
— Is it possible to negotiate a college financial aid package?
— What can we do if our child doesn’t receive enough financial
aid?


```

```
◆ Help your clients complete a trial financial aid test. This
will help you to steer clients away from common mistakes and
toward selecting the college that fits best with the student’s crite-
ria. Remember, the most expensive school is not necessarily out
of reach. The net cost after financial aid may make that college
affordable after all.
◆ Help your clients construct a college budget based on the
adequacy of their retirement plans. In constructing a college
budget, start by evaluating the client’s retirement resources.
Often, an answer to the college cash flow problem is for parents
to share the cost of college with their student rather than bearing
the entire cost alone. It is essential to make realistic assessments of
a family’s financial situation and not to jeopardize one need while
serving another.
◆ Teach your clients and their children how to select the proper
colleges. Different colleges use different kinds of financial aid to
attract the students they want. There are many college informa-
tion books available at local bookstores and libraries that provide
background on this important aspect of college selection.
◆ Plan the financial aid strategy during high school. The earlier
one plans, the better. Clients would do well to start planning when
their student is a sophomore in high school. Colleges track income
and assets for financial aid purposes from the tax return for the
year before the financial aid package is distributed. Help clients
preserve their eligibility. Prevent clients from putting money into
the student’s name, since a higher percentage of student assets and
income than parent assets and income is figured into the financial
aid calculation. Carefully time the liquidation of investments and
taking of capital gains, as well as a spouse’s going back to work.
◆ Fill out financial aid forms correctly. In January and February
of the student’s senior year, parents begin the process of complet-
ing financial aid forms. The planner should ensure that clients
file all required forms, make all deadlines, value the home realisti-
cally, and avoid volunteering any information not asked for.
◆ Compare and evaluate every financial aid award. Do not let cli-
ents assume that a financial aid award is correct or that an initial
award is the best that a college will offer. Using college reference
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
books, you can determine approximately what kind of mix (finan-
cial aid vs. self-help) a client will be granted.
◆ Integrate any college-borrowing plan into a retirement plan.
Once the financial aid amount is determined, figure out how the
clients will actually pay for college. How much of their savings and
investments should they liquidate? How big an emergency fund
should they keep? Should the parents tap into home equity?
◆ Help clients to save, save, save—the right way. Make sure the
client takes into account the following principles:
—Avoid the kiddie tax.
—Control taxation of savings growth.
—Control taxation during the withdrawal phase.
—Provide flexibility to deal with future financial aid eligibility.
— Allow multiple investment options for staying ahead of college
inflation rates, diversifying investment risk, and making changes
at a reasonable cost both as markets change and as clients need
to make changes.
— Maintain a sufficient amount of life insurance to cover the
death or disability of the breadwinner.
— Consider a pay-yourself-first option that allows automatic, sys-
tematic plan deposits.

Income Tax Planning

income tax planning is using any allowable strategy to reduce,
time, or shift either current or future income tax liabilities.
Income tax planning is driven by overall financial objectives and
is not an end in itself. For many families income taxes are their
biggest expense, so the subject deserves special attention.
Your role in the income tax planning process is not necessarily
to do your client’s income tax return. Rather, it is to locate poten-
tial tax savings opportunities, which may result in the need to
reposition your client’s investment allocations. You may want the
client to work with a certified public accountant (CPA) to handle
the more complex issues surrounding income taxes.
Your job is to help clients minimize taxes, which is legal, not
evade taxes, which is illegal. As a result, you should look at tech-
niques for tax deferral (deferring tax until the following year) or


```

```
tax acceleration (accelerating tax into the current year), if appro-
priate. The following checklists highlight a variety of year-end
timing techniques that you can recommend to assist your clients
in minimizing their taxes.
```
```
TECHNIQUES FOR ACCELERATING EXPENSES AT YEAR-END
◆ Pay certain expenses this year that might otherwise wait until
the following year. Do repair work; order supplies or equipment.
◆ Charge deductible expenses on your credit card. Charitable
contributions and medical expenses are deductible when you
charge them, not when you pay the credit card company. This is
an especially astute move to consider at the end of a tax year.
◆ Ask your employer to increase your withholding of state and
local taxes.
◆ Pay fourth-quarter estimated taxes before year-end rather than
by January 15 of the following year.
◆ Bunch miscellaneous deductions. Because miscellaneous item-
ized deductions are deductible only to the extent they exceed 2
percent of adjusted gross income (AGI), it may make sense to
move deductions into the current year in order to exceed your
marginal tax rate (which is the tax rate on your last dollar of
income) if it is higher. Alternatively, if you do not think that will
provide you an allowable deduction, defer paying certain tax-
related expenses until the following year. This essentially lets you
deduct two years’ worth of miscellaneous expenses in one tax
year. Miscellaneous expenses include unreimbursed employee
business expenses, such as business meals and entertainment,
transportation and lodging while away from home, subscriptions
to professional journals, union or professional dues, job-related
continuing education, job-hunting expenses, and uniforms.
Other miscellaneous expenses include investment advisory fees,
investment publications, and safe-deposit-box rental charges.
```
```
TECHNIQUES FOR DEFERRING INCOME AT YEAR-END
◆ If you are self-employed, delay client billing until the following
year. As a self-employed person, you have total control over when
bills are generated and sent to clients.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ Defer bonuses until the following year by arranging this in
advance with your employer.
◆Use the installment method to defer taxable gain on property
sales. If you sell capital-gain property at a profit, you may want to
elect installment-sale treatment. If you arrange a sale in which
payments are made over more than one year, you automatically
qualify for installment-sale treatment. Because the profit from
a sale is taxable in the year of sale, choosing an installment sale
means that only a portion of the gain will be recognized during
the current year, postponing the rest of the gain into the follow-
ing year.
◆ Delay the closing dates for asset sales into the following year.

OTHER TAX-PLANNING MOVES
◆ Realize stock losses or gains while maintaining your investment
position. The lower tax on long-term gains makes sales timing
important, because you are required to offset capital gains with
capital losses before figuring the tax. If you have already taken
long-term gains as the end of the year nears, it may pay to put off
selling shares that would create a loss until the next year and use
those losses to offset more highly taxed regular income. Capital
gains rates keep changing (based on whomever is President). At
the time of this writing, the maximum is 15 percent (but don’t
expect it to stay at that rate forever).
◆ Dispose of passive investments to free up previously disallowed
losses.
◆ Increase your level of participation in business activity to meet
the material participation standard under passive loss rules.
◆Consume expiring loss and credit carryovers that you were
unable to take in prior years because your income was too
high.
◆ Exchange matured E bonds for HH bonds to avoid realizing
accrued interest, since this allows you to defer the interest until a
later date.
◆ Increase or decrease vacation home use in order to have it
treated as either a personal residence or passive activity.


```
The Spectrum of Financial Planning
```

```
◆ Pay contested taxes during the current year. This gives you an
automatic deduction while letting you continue fighting these
taxes during the next year.
◆ Settle insurance or damage claims to maximize the current
year’s casualty loss deduction.
◆ Establish an individual retirement account (IRA) to reduce
your taxable income.
◆ Defer premature IRA payouts to avoid the 10 percent early
withdrawal penalty. However, IRA distributions used to pay medi-
cal expenses are penalty free.
◆ Establish a full spousal IRA deduction. You can contribute
$4,000 for a taxpayer and $4,000 for a spouse into an IRA. This
applies to households where only one spouse works, as long as the
aggregate contributions do not exceed the couple’s combined
compensation for the year.
◆ Incur adoption expenses. Moderate-income taxpayers can
claim a tax credit of up to $10,390 in qualified adoption expenses
per child. The full credit is available for taxpayers whose AGI is
$75,000 or less and is phased out over the next $40,000 of modi-
fied AGI. Qualified adoption expenses consist of reasonable and
necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney’s fees, and various
other related expenses.
◆ Consider moving into your vacation home after retirement in
order to make it your principal residence and qualify for up to
$500,000 of tax-free profit ($250,000 for singles).
◆ Under Code Section 179, a calendar-year business taxpayer
may be able to elect to expense qualifying property such as office
equipment (up to certain annual limits) rather than depreciate it
over a period of time. This provides a larger write-off of expenses
and reduced income.
◆ If a taxpayer furnishes more than half of the support for a par-
ent, he or she can deduct the medical expenses he or she paid for
this parent, subject to the taxpayer’s overall 7.5 percent floor.
◆ A self-employed business owner with an individual retirement
plan can make a current-year contribution up to the due date plus
extensions for filing his or her current-year tax return.

Retirement Planning

a financial planner will discuss two broad aspects of retire-
ment with clients. The first is determining the total amount of
money that a client needs for retirement. This is accomplished by
guiding a client through a retirement needs analysis (see EXHIBIT
4.5 on pages 153–156). The second aspect is advising the client
on retirement plan options. These two aspects of retirement
planning cannot be considered until quantitative and qualitative
information is prepared with the client as in Step 2 of the PIPRIM
financial planning process (see Chapter 3).

DETERMINING CLIENT NEEDS
Once clients have some idea of their retirement goals, the
planner’s task is to help them determine the amount of money
necessary to overfund the goals, thus allowing for unforeseen
financial and life changes. Engage clients in discussions about
what is important to them in retirement. Respond to the clients’
concerns, so that realistic retirement goals can be set and a finan-
cial plan designed. It is necessary to calculate the required level of
savings and investments today and in succeeding years to achieve
the client’s desired retirement income.
In order to invest for a retirement goal, your clients need an
accurate estimate of how much money they will need the day after
they stop working. Of course, the future is uncertain, a simple but
often forgotten fact that clients must understand. You need to
encourage each client to make a set of reasonable assumptions
about future life scenarios (one home or two homes, number of
vacations per year, major expenditures, number of cars) along
with your assumptions about economic conditions during the
client’s retirement span. Together you must build the most
reasonable and probable picture of the client’s minimum and
maximum retirement expectations. This foundation serves as the
point of departure for retirement investment planning. Exhibit
4.5 will assist your client to develop a retirement needs analysis
and funding plan.


```

```
Three Phases of Retirement Planning
another way for the financial planner to look at retirement
planning is in the context of three phases: accumulation, conser-
vation, and distribution. Once you and your clients calculate how
much money they will need during retirement, you will need to
design an investment plan to get there. Clients can accumulate
money in three different types of retirement plans: qualified, per-
sonal retirement, and nonqualified plans.
The conservation phase of retirement planning refers to the
efforts that ensure that clients maximize principal throughout
their working years. For an analysis of methods of maximizing
assets, see the Investment Planning section earlier in this chapter.
Finally, for the distribution phase of retirement planning, the
planner determines the best method and timing for withdrawing
the money that is needed for retirement. Retirement distributions
can be either lump sum or paid out as an annuity.
```
```
Qualified Retirement Plans
qualified plans offer a great income tax benefit for employ-
ers and employees. Employers get a current tax deduction for
amounts contributed to the plan, while employees do not recog-
nize the amount as current income in that taxable year. Employ-
ees can defer tax until the time of distribution, which may be
many years down the road. The box on the following page sum-
marizes the principal types of qualified plans.
```
```
VESTING
Vesting is a key ingredient of any qualified retirement plan. Vesting
is applicable to two separate components: employee contributions
and employer contributions. Employee contributions and salary
deferral contributions are always 100 percent vested. Employer
contributions must provide for minimum standards of vesting
under one of two schedules as presented in the table on page 125:
five-year cliff vesting or three-to-seven-year graded vesting.
This means that at a certain point during employment, an
employee acquires a nonforfeitable, guaranteed interest in
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
benefits under either a defined contribution or defined benefit
plan. A plan cannot have a vesting schedule longer than seven
years. Under a SIMPLE plan (see page 132), however, vesting
must be immediate and nonforfeitable for both employee and
employer contributions. Special vesting rules apply to top-heavy
plans.
Generally, a qualified plan must provide that participants are
fully vested in (have full entitlement to) the portion of the plan
attributable to employer contributions on a schedule that does
not exceed one of the following two alternatives.
◆ Five-year cliff vesting. After five years of service, the partici-
pant is fully vested in his or her account. Employees who leave the
company before working there for five years are not entitled to
any portion of the plan account attributable to employer contri-
butions other than the elective deferral contributions, since the
employer is not required to offer any.

```

```
◆ Three-to-seven-year graded vesting. Vesting must occur at a
rate of at least 20 percent per year beginning after three years of
service. The participant is fully vested after seven years of service.
Alternative vesting schedules can be used as long as they are
as favorable to employees as the two schedules described above.
Regardless of the vesting schedule, an employee is considered
fully vested at the plan’s normal retirement age.
To reiterate, the vesting schedule applies only to employer contri-
butions; employee contributions, elective deferrals, and the interest
earned from those contributions are always fully vested. Employ-
ees also become fully vested upon the termination of a plan.
```
```
CATEGORIZING QUALIFIED PLANS
Qualified plans are generally categorized as either defined contri-
bution or defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans are also
referred to as individual account plans, since each participant has
```
```
Five-Year Cliff Vesting
Nonforfeitable employer contributions
YEARS OF SERVICE PERCENTAGE

```
a separate account for accruing plan contributions and invest-
ment earnings. Defined benefit plans, in contrast, pool the plan
funds; participants receive statements that reflect their accrued
benefits, but the plan may not segregate funds into individual
accounts.
Another method of categorizing qualified plans is to differenti-
ate between pension and profit-sharing plans. Pension plans pro-
vide set benefits—either a fixed benefit or a fixed contribution
level. Defined benefit pension plans provide specific retirement
benefits; money-purchase pension plans and target benefit plans
specify the annual employer contribution to the plan. The profit-
sharing (including stock bonus) plan stands alone as the only type
of qualified plan that does not specify a fixed contribution.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
Under a defined contribution plan, a participant’s benefit is
fixed but not guaranteed until the participant reaches pay sta-
tus. The participant’s benefit is based solely on the following
three features:
1 The amount of contributions made for the participant
2 Reallocated forfeitures from terminated nonvested participants
3 Increases or decreases resulting from income gains, losses, and
expenses

Since investment gains or losses over the life of the plan will ulti-
mately affect the participants’ benefits, a primary characteristic of
a defined contribution plan is that the risk of investment gain or
loss is borne by the participants rather than the employer. Increas-
es or decreases in plan assets will not affect the employer’s con-
tributions or obligations under the plan. Rather, such increases
or decreases will affect only the participants’ ultimate benefits.
A defined contribution plan may, but is not required to, allow
employees to direct the investment of some or all of the money
allocated to their accounts.
There are several types of defined contribution plans. These
include the money-purchase plan, target benefit pension plan,
traditional profit-sharing plan, age-weighted money-purchase and

profit-sharing plan, stock bonus plan, employee stock-ownership
plan, and section 401(k) plan.
◆Money-purchase plan. A money-purchase plan is a formal type
of defined contribution plan in which the company’s contributions
are mandatory and are usually based solely on each participant’s
compensation. The employer annually pays this percentage of com-
pensation to a trust for the benefit of the participant. Generally, the
account balance at retirement is used to purchase an annuity that
provides annual income for the participant’s retirement.
◆ Target benefit plan. A target benefit plan is a hybrid or cross
between a defined benefit plan and a money-purchase plan. Its
defined benefit feature uses a target formula to determine an
annual contribution in order to pay a projected benefit amount
at retirement. As in a money-purchase plan, the contributions
are directed into a separate account for each participant. As in
a defined contribution plan, employers do not have to make up
earnings if expected results differ from actual; only the partici-
pant’s earnings will be higher or lower than projected. The differ-
ence between a money-purchase plan and a target plan is that in
a money-purchase plan, contributions are generally determined
and allocated as a percentage of current compensation, whereas
in a target benefit plan, contributions are determined as if the
plan provided a fixed benefit.
◆ Profit-sharing plan. In a profit-sharing plan, the oldest type of
defined contribution plan, the company agrees to make “substan-
tial and recurring,” though generally discretionary, contributions.
Amounts contributed to the plan are invested and accumulate
tax-free for eventual distribution to participants or their benefi-
ciaries either at retirement, after a fixed number of years, or upon
some event such as layoff, illness, disability, retirement, death, or
severance from employment.
Unlike contributions to a pension plan, contributions to a profit-
sharing plan are usually tied to profits. However, since 1985, nei-
ther current nor accumulated profits are required for a company
to contribute to a profit-sharing plan. The plan must provide a
predetermined formula for allocating contributions among the
participants and for distributing the accumulated funds.

◆ Age-weighted plan. An age-weighted plan is a defined con-
tribution plan that allows higher contribution levels for older
plan participants. The plan is based on the participant’s age and
compensation level. The advantage of this type of plan is that it
allows older participants to build an adequate retirement account
balance in a shorter period of time. It benefits owners of small
businesses and key employees who are older and have been with
the company for a long time.
◆ Stock bonus plan. A stock bonus plan is similar to a profit-
sharing plan except that benefit payments are made in shares
of company stock. A stock bonus plan may distribute cash to a
participant instead of stock, subject to the participant’s right to
demand a distribution of employer securities. If the plan per-
mits cash distributions and the employer securities are not read-
ily tradable on an established market, participants must be given
the right to require the company to repurchase the stock it dis-
tributes to them under a fair valuation formula. Because these
plans require the use of the sponsor’s own corporate securities,
they do not exist for proprietorships, partnerships, and limited
liability companies.
◆ Employee stock-ownership plan (ESOP). An ESOP is a special
type of profit-sharing or stock-bonus defined contribution plan
that can qualify for favorable tax treatment. As in a stock bonus
plan, the employer can contribute company stock instead of
cash. However, the plan must be primarily invested in company
stock. ESOPs not only provide qualified retirement benefits for
employees but also benefit the employer, by creating a market for
the employer’s stock, increasing the firm’s cash flow, supplying
financing for business growth or expansion, and providing an
estate-planning tool for the owners of a closely held corporation.
ESOPs can borrow money to provide the contribution. When
used to borrow money, these plans are called LESOPs (leveraged
employee stock-ownership plans).
◆ Section 401(k) plan. Also called a cash or deferred plan, a
section 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored stock bonus plan
or profit-sharing plan that meets certain Internal Revenue Code
requirements. Unlike other qualified plans, 401(k) plans permit


```

```
employees to make before-tax contributions through a salary
reduction agreement. All 401(k) plans contain a cash or deferred
arrangement (CODA). Under a CODA, employees can opt to
have compensation that their employers would otherwise have
paid directly to them deferred to the plan instead. An employee
can agree to a salary reduction or to defer a bonus that he or she
has coming.
```
```
Personal Retirement Plans
these plans provide many of the same tax benefits as qualified
plans but differ in two ways. First, money cannot be borrowed
from a personal retirement plan. Any distributions are taxed
as ordinary income. Second, in qualified plans participants
born before 1936 can qualify for ten-year income averaging,
but this feature is not available to employees with personal
retirement plans. Personal retirement plans can include indi-
vidual retirement accounts (IRAs), simplified employee pension
plans (SEPs), and savings incentive match plans for employees
(SIMPLE plans).
```
```
TYPES OF IRAS
◆ Traditional IRA. There are two types of traditional IRAs: indi-
vidual retirement accounts (trusts and custodial accounts) and
individual retirement annuities (contracts). Either or both can be
established by an individual to save for his or her retirement.
An IRA must be established with a bank, savings and loan asso-
ciation, credit union, brokerage firm, or other organization that
can demonstrate to the Internal Revenue Service the ability to
lawfully administer the trust. An individual may contribute to an
IRA if he or she satisfies the following requirements:
Age requirement. The law imposes a maximum age restriction
on traditional IRA contributors. An individual must not attain
age seventy by the end of the taxable year. For example, if Marty
is seventy years old on May 31, 2005, he is not eligible to make an
IRA contribution in 2005 because he became seventy before year-
end. However, there is no minimum age requirement for making
IRA contributions.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
_Earned income requirement._ Income must be earned from per-
sonal services rendered. The personal services must be rendered
in the year the income is received.
_Rollover requirement._ IRA rollovers must be from a qualified
retirement plan.
_Contribution limit._ Individuals may contribute to an IRA accord-
ing to the limits shown in the chart above.
If an IRA holder has more than one traditional IRA, the aggre-
gate contributions cannot exceed the limit. Further, the eligible
contribution amount is reduced by the amount contributed to a
Roth IRA, as discussed below.
◆ Coverdell Education Savings Account (formerly Education IRA).
You can make a $2,000 per year, per beneficiary, nondeductible
contribution to a Coverdell ESA. The money must be allocated
for education expenses. These include tuition at a qualified
elementary, secondary, or post-secondary education institution,
books, supplies, equipment required for attendance and enroll-
ment, room and board, and fees.
The earnings in the account grow tax-free as long as distribu-
tions are used for eligible expenses. Coverdell ESA accounts con-
tributions must be made in cash, be made before the designated
beneficiary reaches eighteen years of age, and be less than or
equal to $2,000 per year per beneficiary.

Contributions can be made to one or several Coverdell ESAs
for the same beneficiary provided that the total contributions
are not more than the limits for a year. And contributions can be
made, without penalty, to both a Coverdell ESA and a Qualified
Tuition Program (QTP) in the same year for the same benefi-
ciary. Funds must be used by the time the beneficiary turns thirty
years old or transferred to a younger relative (including cousins,
step-relatives, and in-laws).
◆ Roth IRA. The Roth IRA generally offers the tax benefit of
having all withdrawals available tax-free. The downside is that
contributions to the IRA are not deductible. The basic rules and
regulations of the Roth IRA are the following:
— Contributions can be made after a taxpayer reaches 70^1 ⁄ 2 years
of age (if the combined earned income of the taxpayer and his
or her spouse equals or exceeds the Roth IRA contribution).
— Taxpayers do not have to start taking distributions when they
reach 70^1 ⁄ 2 years old.
— Contributions can be made even if the taxpayer participates in
an employer-sponsored retirement plan.
— The phaseout for the contributions for married couples does
not arise until AGI is $150,000. Once AGI reaches $160,000, the
Roth IRA contribution amount is totally phased out. For singles,
the AGI phaseout begins at $95,000 and ends at $110,000.
— Distributions are tax-free if qualified. Qualification is met if:
(a) the withdrawal is not made within the five-tax-year period
beginning with the year of contribution; and
(b) the distribution is received at or after age 59^1 ⁄ 2 , or the dis-
tribution is received in the event of death or disability, or
the distribution is for a first-time home buyer.
— The five-year-tax period in (a) above starts with the year for
which the contribution is made. This means that if a Roth IRA
contribution for the year 2004 were made between January 1,
2005, and April 15, 2005 (the date for filing the 2004 income
tax return), the five-year waiting period would still start with
2004, not 2005.
— Nonqualified withdrawals are included in taxable income if
they come from earnings on the Roth IRA account. However,
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
the withdrawals are considered to be made from contributions
to all of the taxpayer’s Roth IRAs first.
— A 10 percent early withdrawal penalty applies if the taxpayer is
not yet 59^1 ⁄ 2 years old, unless the withdrawal is for death, disabil-
ity, periodic payments (meeting certain requirements), home
ownership, or higher-education expenses.
— The maximum annual contribution is the lesser of 100 percent
of earned income or $4,000, less any amounts made to a regular
IRA. The contribution must be made by April 15 of the following
year, the deadline for filing the previous year’s tax return.
— The Roth IRA must be designated as such when it is estab-
lished.
◆ SEP. A simplified employee pension (SEP) is a pension plan
established by a business on behalf of the employee in which the
contributions are deposited into IRAs and are tax deductible by
the employer. This simpler version of a qualified plan is espe-
cially suitable for small businesses. Any employer, including a sole
proprietor with no employees, can establish a SEP for all eligible
employees. The owner of the business is also eligible to receive a
SEP contribution. Since an employer contributes directly to the
SEP IRA, no separate pension trust is needed.
A SEP is primarily distinguishable from an IRA by its higher
annual contribution limit. An employer may contribute as much
as 25 percent of compensation, up to a maximum of $42,000, to
an employee’s SEP.
◆ SIMPLE plan. The savings incentive match plan for employees,
or SIMPLE plan, offers a retirement-plan option for businesses
with one hundred or fewer employees. Available since 1997, the
plan was introduced as part of the many-faceted Small Business
Job Protection Act of 1996. SIMPLE retirement plans are designed
to offer greater deferral opportunities than ordinary IRAs. They
also have fewer restrictions and administrative requirements than
traditional pension or profit-sharing plans. SIMPLE plans can be
in either an IRA format or a 401(k) format.
Under a SIMPLE IRA plan, any employee with compensation
of at least $5,000 must be permitted to enter a “qualified salary
reduction arrangement.” Under this arrangement, employees


```

```
can elect to contribute up to $10,000 of their compensation per
year by deferring a portion of their salary to an IRA. This portion
must be expressed as a percentage of compensation, not as a flat
amount. The $10,000 maximum contribution may be increased
periodically to reflect cost-of-living adjustments. In addition, if
you are over age fifty, an annual catch-up provision of $2,000 (in
addition to the $10,000 maximum contribution) can be made.
```
```
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS
A defined benefit plan is an employer-sponsored plan providing
a predetermined or defined benefit. Each year that a participant
is in the plan, the participant earns or accrues an additional por-
tion of that ultimate promised benefit. Participants who leave the
company before normal retirement age are generally entitled to
the portion of their accrued benefit that is vested.
A defined benefit plan typically provides benefits based on a
combination of compensation and service or plan participation.
However, it is not unusual for a collectively bargained defined
benefit plan to provide benefits based on a flat dollar amount.
The maximum promised benefit is calculated assuming that the
participant remains in the plan until the normal retirement date.
A defined benefit plan must provide determinable benefits.
If the plan realizes forfeitures from nonvested employees, those
forfeitures must be used to reduce future employer contributions
and cannot be used to increase the benefits of the remaining par-
ticipants. These plans may not provide for in-service distributions;
in other words, defined benefit plans may not allow distributions
to participants who are still working unless the participant has
attained the plan’s normal retirement age.
◆ Pension plan. A pension plan is a qualified employer plan
that guarantees a specified benefit level at retirement. It is used
to provide older employees with the maximum amount of tax-
deferred savings and to provide an adequate level of income to
employees regardless of their age at plan entry. Employers are
obligated to fund the plan annually and assume the risk of bad
investment results. Benefit levels are guaranteed both by the
employer and by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
(PBGC). The annual employer contribution is determined each
year by an actuary.
◆ Cash balance plan. A cash balance plan is a qualified employer
pension plan that provides for annual employer contributions at
a specified rate to hypothetical individual accounts that are set
up for each plan participant. The employer guarantees not only
the contribution level but also a minimum rate of return on each
participant’s account.
◆ Hybrid plan. Where defined benefit plans have a defined con-
tribution component that is based partly on the balance of partici-
pants’ separate accounts, these plans are known as hybrid plans
and are considered both defined contribution plans and defined
benefit plans.

Nonqualified Plans

plans that do not meet federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) guidelines and Internal Revenue Code
requirements are considered nonqualified and cannot avail
themselves of the preferential tax attributes. The best example
of a nonqualified plan is an individually designed deferred
compensation arrangement set up exclusively for one or more
executives.
Generally, employees recognize income in the year that their
rights to plan benefits become nonforfeitable. Only then are
employers allowed to deduct contributions made. Nevertheless,
due to the expanded coverage rules enacted under recent tax law
changes, some employers might find it less costly to establish a
nonqualified plan.
Nonqualified plans represent contractual arrangements in
which the company compensates key executives at a later date for
current-year services. Nonqualified plans are not subject to the
coverage, funding, or distribution rules that apply to qualified
plans. Therefore, nonqualified plans can be designed to meet
each executive’s specific needs.
One type of nonqualified plan, a rabbi trust, is essentially an
irrevocable trust involving retained administrative powers under
which assets can be used to pay other liabilities. Therefore, it is


```
The Spectrum of Financial Planning
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
considered to be a grantor trust, with the employer being taxed on
the income. To avoid this tax, the trust assets should be invested.
The assets remain subject to the employer’s creditors in the
event of insolvency, but no other condition need be imposed
on payment of the benefits. The benefits of key employees are
typically vested. Since the assets of a rabbi trust remain subject to
creditors’ rights, there has been no transfer of property. Conse-
quently, no income is imputed to the intended beneficiary until
benefits are actually received.
```
```
Distributions from Retirement Plans
generally, all distributions from qualified retirement plans are
included in the recipient’s gross income when received. Taxation
of certain types of distributions may be postponed through a tax-
free rollover to an IRA or another qualified retirement plan. In
some cases, favorable tax treatment may be available for a lump-
sum distribution. Loans taken from qualified retirement plans
are not taxable if certain requirements are met. Distributions to
beneficiaries generally are included in the deceased participant’s
estate for federal estate tax purposes.
```
```
LUMP-SUM DISTRIBUTION
A lump-sum distribution is a distribution of the balance held in
a qualified retirement plan made on account of the employee’s
death, attainment of age 59^1 ⁄ 2 , separation from service (except
for self-employed individuals), or disability (for self-employed
individuals only).
A distribution will not qualify as a lump-sum distribution unless
the employee was a plan participant for at least five years prior to
the year of distribution. The IRS has ruled that plan participants
who have their entire account balances transferred directly from
an old plan to a new plan may include years of participation in
both plans to satisfy the five-year participation requirement. This
five-year participation requirement does not apply to a beneficiary
receiving a distribution after the participant’s death.
Lump-sum distributions may qualify for favorable income tax
treatment. Further, the participant (or surviving spouse) may
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
elect to defer payment of taxes by rolling over the distribution
into an IRA or another qualified retirement plan.
◆Lump-sum distribution to a deceased participant’s beneficiary.
If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the deceased participant,
the same options that would have been available to the participant
are available to the spouse.
◆ Taxation of a lump-sum distribution. An employee who has
attained age 59^1 ⁄ 2 and who has completed at least five years of
plan participation prior to the year of distribution has several
income tax options:
— The entire distribution may be reported as ordinary income
and might qualify for ten-year forward averaging.
— The entire distribution may be reported as ordinary income
without electing ten-year forward averaging.
— All or part of the distribution may be rolled over to an IRA
or to another qualified retirement plan; no tax is paid on the
amount rolled over, and the rest is taxed as ordinary income
without the option of electing either five-year or ten-year for-
ward averaging.

If more than one lump-sum distribution is received in a single
tax year, all of the distributions must be aggregated, and the elec-
tion to use forward averaging will apply to the aggregate amount.
◆ Early distribution of benefits. A 10 percent penalty is charged
on benefits distributed from a qualified retirement plan, and the
distribution is included in the employee’s income, unless the dis-
tribution is:
(1) made on or after the date the employee attained age 59^1 ⁄ 2 ;
(2) made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the employee)
after the death of the employee;
(3) attributable to the employee’s disability;
(4) part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments
(not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or
life expectancy) of the employee, or the joint lives (or
joint life expectancy) of the employee and the employ-
ee’s beneficiary, that begin after the employee separates
from service;


```
The Spectrum of Financial Planning
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
(5) made to an employee after separation from service after
attainment of age 55;
(6) a dividend paid on stock held by an employee stock-owner-
ship plan (ESOP);
(7) a payment to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order (QDRO); or
(8) an amount equal to or less than the total medical expenses
deductible for the year by the employee.
```
```
Exceptions 5, 7, and 8 above are not applicable to a distribu-
tion from an individual retirement plan; and for exception 4 to
apply to an individual retirement plan, separation from service is
not required. The penalty tax applies only to distributions from
qualified retirement plans, individual retirement plans, and tax-
sheltered annuities.
The 10 percent penalty tax applies only to the portion of the
distribution subject to income tax and is in addition to the income
tax. Thus, the 10 percent penalty tax does not apply to the portion
of the distribution that is income-tax-free. The penalty tax applies
to a participant who made an irrevocable election to defer receipt
of the distribution prior to both the effective date and the date of
enactment of the penalty tax and then received the distribution
thereafter. The 10 percent penalty tax can be avoided if the early
distribution qualifies for rollover treatment and it is rolled over
into another qualified plan or an IRA.
◆ Loans. If the plan permits, a participant may borrow from any
type of qualified retirement plan, including a pension plan. In
fact, loans that meet the requirements of relevant tax laws are
not treated as distributions. As a result, they are not taxable at the
time they are made. However, if a loan fails to meet the tax law
requirements, or if it goes into default or is foreclosed, the partici-
pant may be taxed on the principal of the loan.

term. Failing to plan for the legal and financial aftermath of
death will not spare loved ones from the consequences. They
will simply have less control over their finances than they other-
wise would have.
Planners need to provide information about the various estate
planning tools and techniques that are available to the client.
Most planners are not attorneys and therefore will not be able
to draft estate planning documents for clients—those who do
are practicing law without a license. The biggest responsibility
of planners in estate planning is to ensure that appropriate tools
and techniques are used to successfully achieve client objectives
as reflected in the client’s estate plan.
The pitfalls of inadequate estate planning are illustrated in
the example of two brothers who owned a $4 million manufac-
turing business. Both brothers were in their forties, and each
had a son who planned to step into the family business. At family
functions it was always joked that the sons would inherit the busi-
ness from their fathers and double its size. Unfortunately, one of
the brothers died of an unexpected heart attack. The executor
of the deceased brother’s estate read the will, which stated that
his half of the business would go to his son. After the funeral,
the son of the deceased brother went to the office to work with
his uncle. The uncle asked what the nephew was doing there.
The nephew responded that he was going to help the uncle cre-
ate an $8 million business, because he was taking over for his
father. The uncle excused himself and came back with a piece
of paper describing the ownership of the business. The piece
of paper established joint tenancy with right of survivorship
( JTWROS). This type of property ownership supersedes a will
and caused the portion of the deceased father’s will related to
the business to be invalid.
The lesson to be learned from this example is to make sure
client goals are documented and clear. Make sure they are con-
sistent with other business and estate documents. If they are not,
changes need to be made immediately. Beyond that, refer clients
to an attorney who specializes in estate planning.

TRANSFERRING PROPERTY DURING LIFE
◆ Gifts. The best transfer technique for reducing the size of a
probate estate is gift giving. Probate is a procedure established by
law for the orderly distribution of estates. It is designed to ensure
that all of a decedent’s property is collected and protected, that
all debts are paid, and that the beneficiaries promptly receive des-
ignated assets.
The law allows every person to give anyone each year up to
$11,000 for an individual recipient or $22,000 for a married cou-
ple. The law does not limit the number of recipients, although
gifts exceeding $11,000 for a single person or $22,000 for a mar-
ried couple are considered taxable gifts, with the tax paid by the
giver in most cases. At the time of death, the IRS totals the tax-
able gifts made during a lifetime and subtracts this total from the
estate exemption (unified credit) limit.
The amount that a beneficiary is entitled to receive without
incurring estate taxes was $1.5 million in 2005.
```
```
TRANSFERRING PROPERTY AT DEATH
Property can be transferred at death by will, intestate, contract,
trust, or operation of law.
◆ Will. A will is a legal document that specifies how a person
(the testator) wants to dispose of the real and personal property
owned at the time of death.
◆ Intestate. When a decedent dies intestate, or without a will, the
state decides where the property will go. Each state has different rules
on how property passes. These laws are usually based on a lineal or
collateral family relationship to the decedent at the time of death.
◆ Contract. Certain parties and/or beneficiaries are named by a
decedent in an estate planning contract. The decedent names a
designated beneficiary who receives property. Contracts can pass
through life insurance (where a primary and a contingent benefi-
ciary are listed), a pension (where beneficiaries are also named),
or a trust. Contractual beneficiaries supersede other beneficiaries
with respect to the property in a will.
◆Trust. A trust is a legal relationship used to split beneficiary
interests from the management of a property. There are many
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
different types of trusts. Some of the more popular trusts
include the marital (type A), bypass or credit shelter (type B),
qualified terminable interest property, or QTIP (type C), and
estate (type D).
_Marital trust (type A)._ A marital trust is established to hold
property, usually for the life of the surviving spouse. It permits
unlimited transfers to a surviving spouse. The manner in which
property passes to a surviving spouse is quite flexible. Property
can pass through an outright bequest to the spouse or by opera-
tion of law (see description below). Alternatively, one can arrange
for the use of trusts.
The surviving spouse gets the income from the trust for life
and can direct the disposition of the assets during life or at death.
Type A trusts qualify for the unlimited marital deduction and are
often used to ease asset administration or to permit a trustee to
invest assets in the event that the surviving spouse is unable to
invest or direct the assets. The trust’s assets are included in the
surviving spouse’s estate.
_Bypass or credit-shelter trust (type B)._ The bypass trust, also called
a credit-shelter trust or nonmarital trust, is designed to take
advantage of the unified credit for the first spouse who dies. The
unified credit represents a federal credit that offsets any estate tax
due on estates valued up to $1.5 million (in 2005). Estates greater
than $1.5 million are required to pay estate tax. The bypass trust
is used in conjunction with a marital deduction trust; because the
decedent generally selects the remainderman (the eventual recipi-
ent of the property), the trust does not qualify for the unlimited
marital deduction. The bypass trust receives just enough assets to
absorb the unified credit remaining at the decedent’s death ($1.5
million for 2005).
The income from the type B trust often goes to the surviving
spouse. However, the survivor will have no power over the final dis-
position of the assets of the trust. A bypass trust may also give the
surviving spouse a five-and-five power, which permits the survivor
to withdraw principal up to the greater of 5 percent of the assets
or $5,000 per year. A type B trust lets the surviving spouse receive
an economic benefit from the assets, usually the income received

```
from the trust, while taking advantage of the decedent’s unified
credit. However, the assets in a type B trust are not included in
the surviving spouse’s estate. It is called a bypass trust because the
property, along with any appreciation and income accumulation,
will bypass taxation in the surviving spouse’s estate.
Qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust (type C).
A QTIP trust is similar to a type A (marital) trust except that
it allows you to provide a life income interest for your spouse
while determining in your will who will take the property after
your spouse’s death. A QTIP trust qualifies for the marital
deduction only to the extent that your executor elects to claim
it. This provides added flexibility to the estate because it allows
the executor to decide if there may be some tax advantage to
be gained from paying tax in the first estate. This technique is
useful for clients in second marriages who wish to leave prop-
erty for the surviving spouse’s benefit and then to the children
of the first marriage.
Estate trust (type D). An estate trust permits income to accumu-
late without forcing annual income distributions. Assets trans-
ferred to a type D trust must qualify for the unlimited marital
deduction, because the principal and accumulated income
must be distributed to the surviving spouse’s probate estate on
death. It is only useful to the truly wealthy, because it permits
the trustee to accumulate funds that would otherwise have to be
distributed.
◆ Operation of law. Besides contracts, operation-of-law con-
siderations also supersede a will. For example, as noted previ-
ously, holding property as joint tenants with right of survivorship
( JTWROS) supersedes property passing through a will.

4 Some people want their investments primarily to grow in value
and secondarily to produce regular income. Others primarily seek
regular income rather than growth. These objectives may be long
term (5 years or longer), medium term (2 to 5 years), or short
term (up to 2 years). Which statement best reflects your objec-
tive and its term?
a. To have my investment grow in value over the years rather than
to receive regular income from my investment
b. To have my investment grow in value, though I am investing for
the medium term
c. To receive regular income from my investment, even though I
am investing for the long term
d. To receive regular income rather than having my investment
grow in value, though both are important to me because I am
investing for the medium term
e. To receive regular income rather than having my investment
grow in value, because I am investing primarily for the short

5 People save money for several purposes. You should always have
money set aside for emergencies, of course. But you also save
for other reasons, from a dream vacation in the not-too-distant
future to far-off retirement. The main purpose for the money you
are now considering for investment is to:
a. Start or add to my retirement fund, which I do not anticipate
using for 20 or more years
b. Start or add to a nest egg, which I do not anticipate needing
for the foreseeable future
c. Start or add to a savings fund, which I may use for a rainy day
in 5 or 10 years
d. Save up for a special purpose in the near future
e. Get a slightly higher return than I get in a certificate of deposit
or savings account
```
```
6 How do you expect your annual income to vary over the next 2
years?
a. To increase substantially
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
b. To increase somewhat
c. To keep up with inflation
d. To decrease
e. To decrease substantially

7 Comparatively, how much income do you expect to have avail-
able for discretionary purchases, savings, and investment over
the next 2 years?
a. Substantially more than I have now
b. Somewhat more
c. About the same
d. Somewhat less
e. Substantially less

8 Investment markets fluctuate. Though the long-term direction has
been generally upward, there have also been periods of decline.
From a practical standpoint, not considering your views about
taking risks, how easily could you replace investment declines
with future higher income?
a. Very easily
b. Easily, with some planning involved
c. It would be difficult
d. It would be very difficult
e. It would be impossible

9 Now consider your personal feelings about watching the ups
and downs of the stock market. If you owned investments, how
would rises and falls in the market affect you emotionally?
a. Short-term movements in the investment market would not
affect me.
b. Short-term movements would affect me minimally.
c. Short-term movements would indirectly affect me.
d. Short-term movements would directly affect me.
e. Short-term movements would dramatically affect me.

10 What would you do with your investment if the market fell?
a. Not take my money out of the market, regardless of how

severe the decline
b. Consider taking my money out of the market only if the
decline were substantial
c. Probably take my money out of the market if the decline were
substantial
d. Take my money out even if the decline were not substantial
e. Take my money out no matter how small the decline
```
```
11 Which statement best describes your investment prefer-
ences?
a. I invest primarily to increase the value of my investment.
b. I invest to receive regular payments, even though that means
somewhat smaller potential for my investment to grow.
c. I invest primarily to receive regular payments from my invest-
ment, and increases in value are of little importance.
d. My desire to preserve my investment is primary and out-
weighs my desire to have it increase in value or to receive
payments from it.

Retirement Planning Work Sheet
Please complete this three-part work sheet to determine the
amount of income you will need in retirement and the savings
you will need to reach your income target. After you complete this
work sheet, meet with your financial planner to prepare a retirement
plan. Annually you will want to update the information as your life
situation and long-term goals change.
```
```
SECTION 1: RETIREMENT EXPENSE FORECAST
This section helps you approximate the annual retirement income
you will need to meet your postretirement standard of living. First
you will calculate the approximate income necessary to maintain
your desired living standard in today’s dollars. In order to project
annual living expenses during retirement, you must then multiply
your living expenses by an inflation factor.
```
```
Annual retirement expense forecast
Current gross annual income (1) $
Minus amount of annual savings (2)^ –$
Subtotal (the amount you spend currently) $
Multiplied by 80% (3)^ $ x .80
Equals the approximate annual cost (in current
dollars) of maintaining your current standard
of living if you were retiring this year $
—Multiplied by inflation factor from table below(4) $
—Equals approximate annual cost (in future
dollars) of maintaining your current standard
of living when you retire $
```
```
Explanations for the planner
(1) “Current gross annual income” includes all income from all sources.
(2) “Annual savings” includes, in addition to the usual sources of savings, reinvested
dividends and capital gains, and any contributions to retirement plans that are
taken from annual income.
(3) The general rule is that a retiree can maintain his/her preretirement standard
of living by spending roughly 80% of pre retirement annual income. Individual cir-
cumstances may dictate a higher or lower percentage. Ideally, you should prepare
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
a retirement budget that details expected expenses. This information can be
obtained from the “interactive data-gathering stage” explained in Chapter 3. You
may need a multiplier of less than 80% in some circumstances (for example, for
clients who have paid off a mortgage, lowering their housing costs) or, in other cir-
cumstances, a higher multiplier (for example, extensive travel plans).
(4) The inflation factor multiplies the annual cost of living to account for price inflation
at the time of retirement.

SECTION 2: RETIREMENT INCOME AND SAVINGS FORECAST
This section helps estimate the annual savings needed to generate
future income to meet retirement expenses. The first calculation is
for the first year of savings toward retirement (Line 7). Annual savings
should be increased by 5% (or more) each year until retirement.

6 Multiplied by 17(4) $
7 Equals necessary savings/investments
in future dollars by retirement age to
fund retirement(5) $
```
```
Explanations for the planner
(1) Use inflation factor table for the appropriate multiplier.
(2) Employers usually provide pension plan projections at retirement age expressed in
current dollars. Multiply this number by an inflation factor to approximate benefits
in future dollars.
(3) Social Security estimates are expressed in current dollars and therefore must be
adjusted for inflation.
(4) As a general rule, for every $1,000 of annual income you will need to fund at retire-
ment age, you will need to have at least $17,000 in savings/investments to keep up
with inflation. If you plan to retire before age 62, use a factor of 20 rather than 17.
(5) Clients may be dismayed by the amount of savings needed to fund retirement. The
number can easily exceed $1 million for younger persons and/or people with mini-
mal pension benefits. Nevertheless, good savings habits combined with the power
of compounding interest can usually close the gap between current resources and
eventual needs.
```
```
SECTION 3: RETIREMENT SAVINGS ESTIMATOR
This section of the Retirement Planning Work Sheet can be used to
forecast private pension and Social Security benefits at retirement
and to approximate any additional savings or investment needed to fill
a potential shortfall between those benefits and total income needs.

20 .0151 40 .0022
```
Explanations for the planner
(1) Resources that are currently available typically include the current value of all invest-
ment-related assets that clients do not expect to use before retirement. Do not
include the value of your clients’ home unless they expect to sell it to raise money
for retirement. Do not include any vested pension benefits if you have already fac-
tored them in on Line 2 of Section 2.
(2) The appreciation factor helps estimate what currently available retirement resources
will be worth at retirement. The appreciation factor assumes a 7.5% after-tax rate of
appreciation.
(3) The annual savings factor helps compute the amount clients need to save during the
next year in order to begin accumulating the retirement funds needed by retirement.
The annual savings factor assumes a 7.5% after-tax rate of return.
(4) The annual savings needed to accumulate a retirement nest egg assumes that clients
will save on a regular basis.


just like many other types of professional practi-

tioners, financial planners must adhere to a strict

set of rules and regulations. Planners who advise on

investment and insurance in particular must follow

the various regulations that oversee those areas. Rules

governing these two aspects of financial planning

practice will be the primary focus of this chapter.

The securities industry is regulated at both the federal

can be issued, registered, sold, and traded. At the federal level,
the principal acts that regulate the industry are the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which
are discussed in detail later. The basis for industry regulation
at the state level is the Uniform Securities Act, which each

◆ IAR: An investment adviser representative is any partner, offi-

an investment adviser who (1) gives investment advice or makes
recommendations, (2) manages client accounts or portfolios,
(3) chooses investment recommendations or advisory services, or

membership organization subject to Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) oversight. Its members are securities firms. It was
created by an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
to promote fair trade in the securities industry. One of the NASD’s

◆ RIA: A Registered Investment Advisor is a financial services
industry person or firm who gives investment advice about secu-

administrator(s).
◆ RR: A registered representative is an individual who has
been sponsored by a registered broker-dealer to take the secu-
rities exams required by the NASD and/or state(s) that are
relevant to the products the individual will be selling. Advisers
who are likely to buy or sell mutual funds, variable annuities,
or variable life insurance should take the Series 6 examination.
Advisers who need to buy or sell securities other than mutual
funds should take the Series 7 General Securities Represen-
tative Exam. Once the RR is licensed, the broker-dealer (BD)
holds the RR’s securities license(s) and supervises the RR to
ensure compliance with the securities laws. Through the BD,
the RR can buy and sell appropriate securities. An RR might
be a BD’s employee or an independent contractor supervised
by a BD. An RR’s registration is only in effect while the RR is
associated with the registered BD.
◆ SEC: The Securities and Exchange Commission was created
by an act of Congress in 1934 as an independent, quasi-judicial
agency of the U.S. government. It administers laws in the secu-
rities field and protects investors and the public in securities

only investment advice, they must follow the investment adviser
regulations set at either federal or state levels, depending on
the amount of assets under management. An investment adviser
must be registered and licensed with the NASD or the state(s) in
which the practice is located.
So how does someone know which rules to follow? This chapter
explains the various organizations, tests, and state and federal reg-
ulations important to financial advisers. The scope of a practice
will determine which guidelines apply for each person.

Complying with the Law

REQUIREMENTS FOR SELLING INSURANCE
To sell insurance, people must be licensed by the state(s) in which
they do business. Under the McCarron Ferguson Act, individual
states are responsible for their insurance-practice regulations.
The states take this even more seriously since a 1994 case in which
agents in Florida were found to have engaged in widespread
improper sales practices. The purpose of insurance regulations is
to protect the public from being misled or deceived into making
unwise and potentially harmful decisions affecting their finances
and well-being.
Insurance salespeople who sell life insurance, disability insur-
ance, annuities, and health insurance must pass a “Life and
Health” state license examination. Those wishing to work with
securities of any type, such as variable life and variable annuities,
must register with the NASD. Those who sell home owners, auto-
mobile, or liability (umbrella) insurance must take a “Property
and Casualty” examination. These insurance tests are not terribly
difficult in most states, but the bureaucratic process of applying
to take the exam can be cumbersome, with long delays. People
planning to practice outside of their home state need to comply
with the other state’s reciprocity arrangements. That may mean
taking another exam, getting a letter of good standing from the
state division of securities, taking an ethics examination, or get-
ting bonded (insured).

Steps in the NASD Licensing Process
1 Select a broker-dealer to be your sponsor.
2 Complete form U-4 (Uniform Application for Securities
Industry Regulation or Transfer). This form is similar to an
employment application and states that you will adhere to
securities laws and regulations. Submit it to the broker-
dealer. Check off the states in which you are applying for
registration.
3 Fingerprints are taken at the testing site. The broker-
dealer conducts background checks.
4 The broker-dealer registers the applicant by filing the
U-4 and fingerprints with the NASD.
5 The NASD approves or disapproves the application and
sends the broker-dealer a status report. Conduct unworthy
of an investment adviser may result in disapproval. Once
you are approved, you submit the status report to schedule
the appropriate tests.
6 Take the appropriate securities exams. Results from the
exam are recorded electronically and immediately given to
the applicant.
7 The NASD sends the sponsoring broker-dealer a bill for
your state registration(s).
8 Update your U-4 as necessary to keep it accurate.
9 If you leave your sponsoring broker-dealer, the firm must
file a Form U-5 (uniform termination notice for securities
industry registration) with the NASD. You provide a copy of
the U-5 to your next NASD employer and obtain a new Form
U-4 and fingerprints for the new broker-dealer to submit to
the NASD.

the investment examinations, the Series 6 probably requires the
least preparation time. Passing the Series 6 allows you to sell very
specific types of products, such as mutual funds and some variable
insurance policies. To sell mutual funds, variable annuities, and
variable life insurance or stocks, bonds, and options, you need to
take the Series 7 exam. This examination is much more difficult,
comprehensive, and time-consuming than the Series 6. The Series
7 is a six-hour examination that tests knowledge of securities defi-
nitions, compliance laws, and other factors. The NASD permits
people to retake the exam as many times as they wish after wait-
ing periods ranging from thirty days to six months, depending on
how many times the applicant has failed. Large brokerages usually
fire employees who fail even once.
Someone who decides to take the examination must apply
to the NASD. This agency reviews the application (U-4) and
the form specifying which examination that individual wants
to take (U-10). In addition to passing the Series 6 or Series 7,
the candidate must sit for the Series 63 examination (Uniform
Securities Agent State Law Examination), commonly called
the “blue sky” test, since many advisers once sold unaware con-
sumers “the blue sky.” This state licensing examination covers
the laws of the practitioner’s state as well as national securities
industry laws. After passing the Series 63 requirement and
either the Series 6 or 7 exam, a person is qualified to sell secu-
rities to the public.

REGULATIONS FOR INVESTMENT ADVISERS
Professionals using the title of investment adviser are typically
financial planners, pension consultants, or sports and entertain-
ment representatives. Investment advisers must register with their
home state if they manage less than $30 million and with the SEC
if they manage more than that amount. At that point, the profes-
sional becomes a Registered Investment Advisor. The definition
of investment adviser is in Section 202(a)(11) of the 1940 Invest-
ment Advisers Act:

or reports concerning securities...
```
```
In other words, the definition of a Registered Investment Advi-
sor is as easy as ABC: advice, business, and compensation.
◆ Advice pertains to information about securities, no matter how
broad. In fact, the advice need not be specific. As a result, even if
you provide only general asset allocation advice about categories
of securities, or even suggest that a client buy a tax-free municipal
bond, you have given advice and thus meet the first test.
◆ Business means you are “in the business” or that it constitutes
a business activity of some regularity. In addition, if you hold
yourself out as being in the business, meaning that you identify
yourself as one who gives investment advice, for example, on your
business card, you are deemed to be in the business and thus
would meet the second test.
◆ Compensation means that someone has to pay you for that
advice. It can be satisfied through a fee, a commission, or a com-
bination thereof. The compensation can come from any source.
It does not have to come from the person directly receiving the
benefit of your expertise. In fact, referral fees from third parties,
financial planners, and money managers all qualify. All of these
examples would thus meet the third test.
```

EXCEPTIONS TO THE DESIGNATION
AS INVESTMENT ADVISER
There are many exceptions to the definition of investment
adviser, including the following:
◆ Institutions, such as banks, savings institutions, or trust com-
panies
◆ Professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, engineers, or teach-
ers, whose performance of these services is solely incidental to the
practice of their profession
```

```

```
◆ Broker-dealers who offer investment portfolio advice as part
of their business of being a broker-dealer and receive no special
compensation for that service
◆ Publishers and employees of any financial publications (such as
newspapers and magazines) that disseminate generic investment
information to the general public
◆ Persons without an office in the state whose only clients are
institutions
◆ Persons without an office in the state who do not direct business
communications to more than five clients (other than institutions)
◆ Any person that the state administrator of the Uniform Securi-
ties Act decides not to include

EXEMPTIONS FROM REGISTRATION
The preceding list indicates those individuals or entities falling
outside the act’s definition of investment adviser and outside
the parameters established by the SEC. An exemption, however,
excuses someone who _is_ an investment adviser from the need to
register. Exemptions include the following:
◆ Persons who do no business in the state
◆ Advisers with a _de minimis_ exemption—having fewer than five
clients in any twelve-month period or fewer than a number set by
the state. Clients consist of broker-dealers, financial or institution-
al investors (such as banks, insurance companies, or investment
companies), or other investment advisers.

Registration Procedures

qualifying for SEC registration as an investment adviser
includes applying, passing an examination, and meeting ethical
guidelines.

APPLICATION
Complete the application (Form U-4, if one has not been filed,
and form ADV) and pay the appropriate designated filing fee
(as set by each state). The application contains the following
information:
◆ Form and place of business organization

◆ Proposed method of doing business
◆ Qualifications and business history of the applicant
◆ History of injunctions
◆ Financial condition and history
◆ Client brochure
```
```
EXAMINATION
Each state has specific requirements. Most states require the Series
65 Examination (Uniform Investment Adviser Law Examination)
and the Series 63 Examination (Uniform Securities Agent State
Law Examination). Advisers wishing to combine both exams into
a single test-taking experience can opt for the Series 66 (Uniform
Combined State Law Examination) in their place. In many states,
attaining CFP certification can waive the Series 65 examination.
To find out whether this is the case in your state, check with your
state securities division. An applicant who has passed the exam
does not have the right to transact business until a license or reg-
istration is granted.
```

MAINTAINING ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
Investment advisers (IAs) are required to act as fiduciaries and
follow strict ethical guidelines when managing people’s money.
These guidelines were developed by the North American Securi-
ties Administration Association (NASAA) through a Statement of
Policy (SOP), which defines unethical business practices of invest-
ment advisers and addresses the following:
◆ Suitability. IAs are responsible for making a reasonable inquiry
of the client’s financial situation, investment objectives, and needs
before making any recommendations.
◆ Discretionary authority. IAs must receive specific prior verbal
or written authority before placing orders for the account.
◆ Excessive account activity. IAs should not frequently trade on
behalf of their clients without considering client objectives, finan-
cial resources, and character.
◆ Unauthorized trading. IAs cannot use their own discretion to
place orders for clients unless the clients grant verbal or written
authority.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ Unauthorized third-party trading. To place an order given by a
third party, the IA must have prior written authorization from the
client. This includes husbands not being able to place orders for
wives, and vice versa.
◆ Borrowing money or securities. No borrowing of money or
securities is allowed unless the client is a broker-dealer, bank,
financial institution in the business of lending money, or person
affiliated with the adviser.
◆ Lending money. No lending of funds is allowed unless the
adviser is a bank, financial institution in the business of lending
money, or person affiliated with the adviser.
◆ Misrepresentations and omissions. IAs cannot omit or misrep-
resent through exaggeration, falsification, or omission the quali-
fications of the adviser or its employees, the nature of the services
offered, or the fees to be charged.
◆ Third-party reports or recommendations. IAs cannot provide
clients with reports or recommendations prepared by third par-
ties without disclosure of the source unless the advisers use the
information as the basis for their recommendations.
◆ Unreasonable fees. Unreasonable fees are unethical even if the
client agrees to them in advance.
◆ Material conflicts of interest. Any conflicts of interest that
might influence the decision of a potential client to employ the
services of the IA must be disclosed to the client before entering
into an advisory agreement.
◆ Performance guarantees. IAs cannot guarantee specific invest-
ment performance, such as making a profit or backing an invest-
ment for clients.
◆ Advertisements. The laws prohibit untrue statements of mate-
rial fact, testimonials, references only to specific past recommen-
dations, guarantees of future performance, offering free services
without the intent to perform, and references to charts, tables,
formulas, or other devices used to forecast securities prices with-
out spelling out the difficulties or limitations in their use.
◆ Disclosure of client information. IAs cannot disclose client
information to third parties unless required by law or with the
client’s consent.

◆ Custody or possession of client funds or securities. Client
funds must be kept safely through segregation and identification
by client. Funds must be deposited into trustee accounts with
prior notice given to client. Itemized reports must be provided
quarterly, and the account should be verified by an independent
public accountant’s unscheduled audit.
◆ Investment advisory contract. All IA contracts must be in writ-
ing and indicate the services to be provided, term of the contract,
amount of advisory fee or formula used to compute the fee, how
refunds are determined for prepaid fees, whether the adviser has
discretionary authority, and that the client’s consent is required
to assign the contract.
In 1996 the National Securities Improvement Act was signed.
Title III of the Act, known as the Investment Adviser Supervision
Coordination Act, became effective July 8, 1997. A key feature
for RIAs is that the law ended the traditional double registration
requirement; thus, an RIA is no longer required to be registered
with both the SEC and the state. The law allows states to con-
tinue to register investment adviser representatives when the firm
already has SEC registration. However, SEC-registered RIAs are
no longer subject to their home state’s record-keeping, disclo-
sure, or net capital requirements. The law also created a national
de minimis rule of five clients and provided that only the home
state’s rules concerning record keeping, net capital, and bonding
could be applied to state-registered advisers.

MAJOR LEGISLATION REGULATING
THE SECURITIES MARKETS
Congress has passed much legislation over the years to structure
the securities markets in the United States. An adviser must
become familiar with the following regulations that underlie this
industry and affect the development of a practice:
◆ The Securities Act of 1933. This act deals primarily with new
issues of securities. The intent was to protect investors in new secu-
rities by requiring issuers to register an issue with full disclosure
of information when it is first sold to the public. It also requires
that a prospectus (a written offer to sell a security) be given to
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
buyers. The new issue must be registered in each state in which
the underwriter (firm responsible for marketing the security) sells
the security. False information is subject to criminal penalties and
lawsuits by purchasers to recover lost funds.
◆ The Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This act extended the
disclosure requirements to the secondary market and established
the SEC to oversee registration and disclosure requirements. The
intent of this act is to maintain a fair and orderly market for the
investing public. It seeks to attain this goal by requiring organized
securities exchanges to register with the SEC and to agree to be
governed by existing legislation. In addition, the act addresses
regulation of credit through the margin requirements set by
the Federal Reserve Board; registration of insider transactions,
short sales, and proxies; regulation of trading activities and client
accounts; and net capital requirements of broker-dealers. The
registration of securities in no way ensures that investors purchas-
ing them will not lose money. Registration means only that the
issuer has made adequate disclosure.
◆ The Maloney Act of 1936. This act extended SEC control to
over-the-counter (OTC) markets. It provides for the self-regulation
of OTC dealers through the NASD, which licenses and regulates
members of OTC firms.
◆ The Trust Indenture Act of 1939. This act specifies that any
corporate bond issue of more than $5 million and with a maturity
date more than nine months in the future must be issued with a
trust indenture, which is an agreement between the corporate
issuer and a trustee on behalf of the investors. The trust indenture
contains certain promises, monitored by an independent trustee,
that protect the bondholders.
◆ The Investment Company Act of 1940. This act requires
investment companies to register with the SEC and provides a
regulatory framework within which they must operate. The act
regulates the issuance of investment company securities by set-
ting standards for the organization and operation of investment
companies, the pricing and public sale of the investments, and
the reporting requirements. Each company must state its invest-
ment objectives in the registration statement and prospectus.


```
Compliance and Legal Issues
```

```
Investment companies are required to disclose considerable
information and to follow procedures designed to protect their
shareholders.
◆ The Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This act requires individ-
uals or firms who sell investment advice to register with the SEC.
Registration implies compliance with the law. See the discussion
of some important amendments to this act in the next section of
this chapter.
◆ The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970. This act estab-
lished the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to
act as an insurance company in protecting investors from broker-
age firms that fail. SIPC is a nonprofit corporation, not a govern-
ment-sponsored corporation, such as the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation (FDIC). Members include all broker-dealers
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all mem-
bers of national securities exchanges, and most NASD members.
Each separate customer at a broker-dealer firm is covered for a
maximum of $400,000 in securities and $100,000 in cash. Com-
modities accounts are not covered. Customers with claims beyond
$500,000 are treated as general creditors of the excess amount.
Note that an investor who has several accounts in his own name at
one broker-dealer firm still has a maximum coverage of $500,000,
because the protection is $500,000 per separate customer, not
per account. Assessments are made against brokerage firms to
provide the funds, with backup government support available.
◆ The Securities Act Amendments of 1975. These amendments
abolished fixed brokerage commissions and a movement toward
a national market.
◆ The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act
of 1988. This act expanded the definition of the liabilities and
penalties for the illicit use of nonpublic information. Insiders
(persons who have access to nonpublic information) may be held
liable for more than just transactions in their own accounts. The
act recognizes the fiduciary (the person legally appointed and
authorized to represent another person on his behalf) respon-
sibility of the insider to the issuer, the stockholders, and others
who might be affected by trades made with insider knowledge.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Investors who have suffered monetary damage because of insider
trading have legal recourse against the insider and any other
party who had control over the misuse of nonpublic information.
The SEC can levy a penalty of up to the greater of $1 million or
three times the amount of profit made (or loss avoided) if insider
information is used. Any individual who is a corporate insider and
owns securities in that corporation must file a statement of owner-
ship with the SEC.
◆ The Telephone Communications with the Public Act. This act,
administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
was enacted to protect consumers from unwanted telephone
solicitations. It requires that companies performing telemarketing
services, such as cold-calling, maintain a do-not-call list, institute a
written policy available on demand on maintenance procedures
for the do-not-call list, train reps on use of that list, ensure that reps
acknowledge and immediately record the names and telephone
numbers of customers who ask not to be called again, ensure that
anyone making cold calls for the firm informs the customer of
the name and telephone number or address of the organization,
ensure that telemarketers do not call customers on this list for ten
years, and ensure they only call between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.

whenever Congress passes a new law or makes significant changes
to an existing law like the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, confu-
sion and frustrating legal, regulatory, and procedural issues usually
follow. This is not a surprising or unexpected result but rather
a routine occurrence, since broader and different compliance
responsibilities are often created as part of the new mandate.
The SEC—the federal agency charged with the responsibility
of administering the law in question—is expected to issue clarify-
ing regulations shortly after the enactment of new legislation so
that individuals who are affected by the statutory changes may
learn of and better understand their new responsibilities.

SEC ADMINISTRATIVE RELEASES
In late 1996 the SEC issued two extremely comprehensive and
well-drafted pronouncements known as SEC Release IA-1601


```
Compliance and Legal Issues
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
and SEC Release IA-1602. These releases addressed many unan-
swered questions and clarified some areas of the amendments to
the Investment Advisers Act. The SEC releases made changes in
the following areas:
◆ Eligibility for SEC registration. The SEC devised a form known
as Form ADV-T that has to be filed by every RIA in the United
States to determine eligibility for SEC registration after the new
law went into effect July 8, 1997. The RIA is required to list the
dollar amount of assets under management as of a date within
ten days of filing Form ADV-T. The form also requires the RIA
to declare eligibility for SEC registration. Miscellaneous catego-
ries of eligibility are set forth on Form ADV-T. (Form ADV-S has
been abolished.)
◆ Determining the amount of assets under management. “Assets
under management” are defined as the securities portfolios for
which an RIA provides continuous and repeated supervisory or
management services. The 1997 releases define a “securities
portfolio” as any account in which at least 50 percent of the total
value consists of securities. Real estate, commodities, and collect-
ibles are not securities and would not be included when counting
up assets. Cash and cash equivalents are also excluded from the
computation. The securities portfolio is determined no more
than ten days before the filing of Form ADV-T. The accounts
must receive “continuous and regular supervisory or manage-
ment services” in order to qualify in the computation of the $25
million to $30 million minimum of assets.
In a significant development in the releases, if the RIA has
nondiscretionary authority, these accounts will not automati-
cally be considered part of the total assets under management.
However, the SEC will consider including accounts over which an
RIA has nondiscretionary authority if the RIA provides ongoing
management services. The SEC release says, “The SEC believes
that a limited number of nondiscretionary advisory arrange-
ments involve assets under management on a continuous and
regular supervisory or management basis.... Whether an adviser
that does not have discretionary authority will be considered to
provide continuous and regular management or supervisory ser-
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
vices with respect to an account would depend upon the nature
of the adviser’s responsibility.”
If the RIA attempts to qualify for SEC registration by assert-
ing that assets under nondiscretionary management exceed the
$30 million threshold, a special explanation must be supplied on
Form ADV-T to justify the claim of continuous and regular super-
visory or management services.
◆ Transition between state and SEC registration. The SEC wanted
to avoid on-again, off-again, on-again registering, deregistering,
and re-registering by RIAs whose assets under management fluc-
tuate over and under the $25 million limit. Proposed Rule 203A-1
would permit RIAs having between $25 million and $30 million
of assets under management to determine whether and when to
change from state to SEC registration.
◆ SEC registration required for advisers not registered by their
states. Under the 1997 law, advisers who “are not regulated or
required to be regulated as investment advisers” in the state in
which they have their principal place of business and principal
office must register with the SEC regardless of the amount of
assets under management.
The regulations interpret the 1997 law to mean that any per-
son who meets the statutory definition of an investment adviser
must register with the SEC if:
— the person has a principal office and principal place of busi-
ness in a state that has an investment adviser statute but does
not require registration, and the person is in fact not registered
under that state statute; or
— the person has a principal office and principal place of business
in a state without an RIA statute (only Wyoming, as of February
2002).
◆ Regulations for adviser representatives. The 1997 law provides
that even when an advisory firm is registered with the SEC, the
states can still license, regulate, and otherwise qualify investment
adviser representatives of such a firm that has a place of business
within that state.
The new regulations clarify which persons providing invest-
ment advice on behalf of SEC-registered RIAs would be subject


```
Compliance and Legal Issues
```

```
to continued state registration and qualification.
The new regulations conclude that the term investment adviser
representative as used by Congress means a person who is super-
vised by an investment adviser and who provides a substantial
amount of investment advice to clients who are “natural per-
sons” (not groups or firms). The term would therefore exclude
supervised persons who provide advice to investment companies,
businesses, educational institutions, charitable institutions, and
other entities that are not natural persons. Those representatives,
however, would still be subject to state regulation, even though
the firm itself would need to be registered only with the SEC!
◆ National “de minimis” standard. The 1997 regulations provide
clarification of a national de minimis rule by explaining how to
count clients for purposes of the “fewer than six clients” rule. The
new regulations remind us that client is not defined anywhere,
and the SEC tells us that it will treat as a single client a natural per-
son and (1) any relative or spouse of the natural person sharing
the same principal residence, and (2) all accounts of which such
persons are the sole primary beneficiaries.

State Securities Regulations
besides federal regulation, each state has laws that pertain
to issuing and trading securities in the secondary market. These
“blue-sky laws,” which were devised separately by each state, gave
way to the Uniform Securities Act (USA), which serves as model
legislation for any state to follow. Many of the provisions are
similar to federal laws regulating investment advisers, but there
are some differences, such as the penalties for breaking the law.
Federal law provides for up to five years in prison and a fine of up
to $10,000. State penalties are lower, at three years and $5,000.
Another difference is that advisers managing more than $30 mil-
lion must register with the SEC, and those managing less than
$25 million must register with the state, as discussed previously.
Those in between ($25 million to $30 million) have the option
of registering with either. A third difference is that SEC registra-

tion is effective until it is withdrawn, but state registration expires
annually on December 31.

Protecting Yourself against Liability

professionals providing investment and insurance plan-
ning advice need protection from unintentional negligence in
their practice and possible lawsuits. Many planners do not have
adequate systems in place to collect client data or appropriate
training to provide key information. Not all planners are good
at managing client expectations. Unfortunately, some planners
jeopardize their practices when concerns for compensation begin
to take precedence over a client’s best interests.
If clients lose significant wealth, even though it may not be the
planner’s fault, they may sue and generate enough jury sympathy
to win a lawsuit. Protection from mistakes and unavoidable dif-
ficulties, therefore, is important.
There are two ways you can protect yourself. The first protec-
tion is through your business format (see Chapter 2). The second
protection is through purchasing an errors and omissions (E&O)
insurance policy.

ERRORS AND OMISSIONS INSURANCE
Many broker-dealers enter into contractual arrangements with a
property/casualty insurer for protection against their negligence
or that of their registered representatives. Self-employed planners
should buy coverage through an insurance company. A person
who is a registered representative of a broker-dealer or an insur-
ance or investment company can acquire E&O insurance directly
from the company.
The relationship between the broker-dealer and its registered
representative is that of principal and agent. The principal may be
held legally responsible for the acts of its agent(s). The mechanism
by which the principal obtains insurance for the negligent acts of
its agents, however, is quite different for broker-dealers than it is
for most other professions. Broker-dealers will sponsor a “group”
insurance program, typically requiring that all of its registered rep-
resentatives purchase insurance as a condition of appointment.


```
Compliance and Legal Issues
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
The broker-dealer sponsors a group E&O insurance program
to be certain that its registered representatives can demonstrate
financial responsibility if their mutual client presents a claim.
What the broker-dealer should understand, however, is that
through the act of sponsoring the insurance program, the
broker-dealer becomes the insurer of last resort if the program
turns out to be insufficient. In other words, the broker-dealer
implicitly warrants that its sponsored insurance program is
adequate.
Imagine that the worst happens: an investor claim is brought
against both the registered representative and the broker-dealer.
The claim is settled against the broker-dealer, but because of some
features of the policy, coverage is not available to the registered
representative, who then pays dearly. The registered representa-
tive in turn initiates legal action against both the insurance broker
and the broker-dealer. The registered representative points out
the following:
◆ that the broker-dealer required insurance program participation
◆ that it informed its registered representatives of the many fea-
tures of the program not generally available with other programs
◆ that the program summary was silent on the features of the
policy that resulted in the denial of coverage to the registered
representative
◆ that the registered representative believed that the cover-
age was adequate because it was so thoroughly approved and
endorsed by the broker-dealer
◆ that the registered representative actually asked about the
policy long before the claim ever arose and was roundly rebuffed
by the broker-dealer’s compliance department
```
```
This unpleasant legal scenario illustrates that the relationship
with the insurer should be one of full and unqualified disclosure
so that the registered representative may make an informed deci-
sion about coverage and so that the broker-dealer is protected
from litigation.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
SCOPE OF COVERAGE
The prevalence of group insurance programs provided through
the broker-dealer stems from a time when most, if not all, of
its registered representatives were employees and had been
schooled extensively in the company’s in-house training pro-
grams. The registered representatives initiated securities trans-
actions and little else. But today’s world differs significantly, as
does the relationship between broker-dealers and registered
representatives.
The typical registered representative today is an independent
contractor and engages in many activities that do not directly
involve the broker-dealer. As noted previously, such activities
might include financial planning; asset allocation; investment
management, either with or without discretionary authority;
sales of life products including life, health, and disability insur-
ance, as well as annuities; and a variety of other services including
accounting or legal services, trust services, third-party pension
plan administration, and actuarial services. Although no single
broker-dealer-sponsored policy could possibly encompass all of
these services, a policy narrowly focused on security sales will
certainly fall short of the mark. The one-size-fits-all approach
implicit in the design of these group programs sows the seeds of
dissatisfaction, not to mention potential liability, for the sponsor-
ing broker-dealer as well as for the investment adviser, particularly
if the program is mandatory.

PRIOR ACTS COVERAGE
Group insurance programs have been made available only
while a registered representative is a member of the sponsoring
group, based on the assumption that the business and insurance
relationship will span a career. But reality is quite a bit different.
The movement of registered representatives from one broker-
dealer to another, or from a commission-based practice to a
fee-only practice, is becoming increasingly commonplace. The
broker-dealer-based insurance does not trail along behind as the
registered representatives adjust their practices. Worse still, that
coverage may not be available at all for services rendered while

the agent was acting as a registered representative of the previ-
ous broker-dealer.
```
```
AVOIDING LITIGATION
“Prevention is the best cure” is an appropriate adage for any finan-
cial planner wishing to avoid litigation. While taking care of clients’
well-being, advisers should make sure to take care of their own.
The following four guidelines can prepare you for future trouble:
1 Document communications and disclosures. Many life insur-
ance agents, as well as financial planners who write insurance
policies for their clients, do not fully appreciate the importance
of documenting disclosures made to their clients. Errors and
omissions claims are frequently won and lost over the ability of
an agent to convince the court that the disclosures made to the
client were professionally given and, if taken to heart by the cli-
ent, might have prevented the client’s injury or, at the minimum,
would not have contributed to the loss.
Disclosure is the communication between the client and the
agent regarding the technical activity involved in selling a policy,
including the duties and obligations of both the agent and the cli-
ent. If a court or arbitrator feels the agent has misled the client to
think the company will pay claims not covered by the policy, the
agent may become first in line to pay for what the court determines
was promised. The issue may be ruled upon by a sympathetic jury,
judge, or arbitrator weighing the oral representations of the client
against whatever documentation the agent has retained after the
passage of years.
Avoiding an errors and omissions claim should be an important
concern in making a sale. Honesty and integrity shine through
during a court hearing. A poor memory is apparent. The courts
are required by law to give the financial adviser a fair hearing. How-
ever, it is the professional adviser’s duty to have the documentation
available to show the court that full disclosures were given, that
the client needed the coverage or approved the purchased item,
and that the questions raised by the client were answered fully and
truthfully. Credibility is not accorded to the professional who relies
on a halting memory unaided by documentation.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
There are certain points in the sales process for insurance and
securities that offer an excellent opportunity for document disclo-
sure. When the adviser makes the presentation, a cover letter can
summarize the client’s needs and concerns and explain how the
attached presentations will address the situation. The opportunity
occurs again when an application is taken and again at policy or
certificate delivery.
2 Keep records for five or more years. Lawsuits against financial
planners and insurance agents are harder to defend against than
many other negligence claims. Attorneys do not usually file lawsuits
until just before the statute of limitations runs out. According to
_Best’s Directory of Recommended Insurance Attorneys and Adjusters,_ the
limit for commencement of action for insurance contracts is four
years. The statute of limitations on tort claims is only one year.
However, a written contract, such as an insurance policy sold by
an agent or planner, may be extended for longer periods because
of later amendments or periodic service. This allows the facts to
become faded or impossible to prove. Documentation, if avail-
able, will help reconstruct the chain of circumstances involved.
3 Make sure clients know their responsibilities and understand
their decisions. Litigation frequently arises out of the failure of
clients to fully disclose all of their past health history, including the
full health history of their dependents. In the event of a moderate
to large claim, any past treatment by a doctor or hospital may be
fully investigated and compared with the original application.
Any misstatement of information regarding a client’s past
health history (preexisting conditions) on an application for
insurance coverage will allow the insurance company to void the
entire insurance coverage back to the date of the original applica-
tion. The company can return all premiums paid less any claims
payments made on the policy. It can also bill the client for the
balance of any additional money paid out over the years for claims
that were not offset by the premium.
Who gets handed the bill? The insurance agent is portrayed as
the bad guy because he or she did not provide the coverage that the
insureds thought they were buying or thought they were promised.
The financial planner is represented as the person who advised

accepting risk when history proves that to have been a poor choice.
If coverage is voided by the insurance company, the courts are
very likely to look to the agent to pay the claim or claims. It is very
important to document that full disclosure has been made with a
signed and dated statement from the client.
The financial planner’s disclosure requirements extend
beyond insurance to issues of risk tolerance, retirement plans,
and even career choices. Because the scope of a comprehensive
plan is broader, the disclosure requirements are greater. Did
the client really understand the principle of diversification?
Did the client understand the principle of dollar-cost averag-
ing? Did the client understand the trade-off between placing
fewer dollars in insurance and more dollars into a qualified
retirement plan?
4 Protect yourself with legal verification. In addition to answers
on the application, a substantial amount of litigation arises
out of what clients said they were told at the time the applica-
tion was taken. An attorney can help draft wording that can
be written on the proposals, similar to “No other coverage has
been promised or implied other than the policy as written and
endorsed and further described in the company’s brochures
and, if requested, a specimen copy of the policy. Questions
regarding coverage must be submitted in writing with the appli-
cation.” Similar documentation could apply to disability and
medical coverage.
This focus on documenting disclosure at the time an appli-
cation is taken will not eliminate the litigation nightmare. In
some cases a client denied benefits may initiate a claim that is
withdrawn when the agent’s documentation is reviewed. Good
documentation will, in the event of a suit or arbitration, give
legal counsel a more defensible position. It will also be a giant
step forward in helping clients receive proper coverage, because
they will understand that they must be very thorough in giving
answers on the application.
The court’s function is to grant relief to an injured party.
Unless a financial planner or insurance agent has documentation
signed by the client, the court will have to interpret the intent of
```

```

```
the parties (agent vs. client). Without documentation accepted
by both parties, the courts consistently hold the agent responsible
for the implied agency relationship and assign responsibility to
the insurance agent to sell a policy that will pay for the damages
that the client incurs.
Where the basic intent of the sales and services are not docu-
mented or are not clear, the attorneys and courts have a basic
responsibility to decide in favor of the injured party. What the
insurance companies do not pay is shifted to the agent.

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY COVERAGE
Those agents who do not believe in buying errors and omissions
insurance are putting their and their families’ financial future
on the line. Agents who say they will buy errors and omissions
coverage later may run up against the provision that known
occurrences are not covered by any policy. If an agent has been
put on notice of a problem, he or she cannot buy insurance to
cover the problem.
Insurance is no substitute for good management practices.
Both are needed by today’s professional agent. Defense costs
alone on a complicated case can run in excess of $100,000.
Good management practices will help control claims and in
doing so will help keep the cost of errors and omissions insur-
ance low.

SEC AUDIT PROCEDURES
Section 209 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 allows the
Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct investigations
of violations and to bring actions to enjoin such activities. In con-
junction with investigations, any person who without cause fails or
refuses to attend and testify or to answer any lawful inquiry or to
produce books or records is guilty of a federal misdemeanor and
is subject to fine, imprisonment, or both.
A recent study released by the SEC reports that since 1981
the auditing of Registered Investment Advisors has increased


```

```

```
by an astonishing 115 percent. Despite what many may believe
and despite what had been reported previously, the SEC is not
decreasing its level of audits.
Text Library System (TLS) of Middletown, Ohio, provides the
following information about a typical SEC audit:
◆Initial contact from an SEC examiner. Surprise visits from
the SEC examiner are not unheard-of. Whether announced
or unannounced, when an examiner appears, he or she must
show appropriate identification. The RIA or the principal for
the firm must cooperate with the examiner and must show the
appropriate records.
Surprise visits currently appear to be the exception to the rule,
although there is no guarantee that this trend will continue. Usu-
ally, as a practical matter, the SEC examiner will phone the office
of the Registered Investment Advisor a few days before the inves-
tigation will be conducted. Even with a phone call in advance, the
adviser has no more than a few days of lead time to prepare for
the visit.
◆ The audit process. The examiner has the legal right to inspect
all books and records of the Registered Investment Advisor as
long as they relate in some fashion to “investment advisory activi-
ties.” Although the SEC auditors have a manual that they may
follow, every auditor’s personality is different and every auditor
will use his or her own methods and procedures. For example,
some examinations last a few hours, and the examiner merely
looks at a few random files to be sure that the “brochure rule”
has been complied with and the required copies are placed in
the clients’ files.
However, other audits last three or four days, while the exam-
iner goes through all seventeen of the record-keeping steps and
goes through almost every file. There is no way to predict the
extent or scope of an SEC audit. However, if there have been
complaints against the RIA, it is clear that the examination will
be an exhaustive one.
◆ Follow-up procedures. Following the completion of the audit,
the SEC examiner will draft a short letter highlighting the out-
come of the investigation if problems or issues raised during the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
examination remain unresolved. This is referred to as the Defi-
ciency Letter.
In the event that the deficiencies or infractions that have been
found are relatively minor, the examiner will merely point them
out to the RIA in the letter and request that the RIA advise the
SEC of what steps will be taken to correct the problems.
If the problems are more numerous and/or severe, however,
or if the RIA refuses within a reasonable amount of time to
correct the discovered violations, regardless of how minor, the
appropriate SEC regional office could institute a compliance
proceeding, which could enjoin “violative activities” or place
limitations on the RIA’s activities. It is unlikely or rare that this
would happen. However, it is possible.
◆ Your response is required. If you receive a Deficiency Letter
you should take immediate action to correct the situation. Then
write to the auditor and provide documentation of your response
to each matter. That should conclude the audit.
Be certain to amend your business practices to avoid the same
problem from recurring. Should you be audited in the next few
years, you can be certain the auditor will have the file and will
check on your continued compliance.


your decision to start a financial planning practice can

be the opportunity of a lifetime if you take the time to

carefully plan and build the infrastructure of your busi-

ness. Entrepreneurs pride themselves on the humble

origins of their ventures. How often do we hear that

a successful start-up began in someone’s garage? Not

so in financial planning. There are fundamentals the

financial planner must include to build a solid business.

BUILDING THE

PRACTICE

INFRASTRUCTURE

##### CHAPTER 6


```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
There is simply no substitute for a strong business foundation
in professional services. You will need to address some basic
questions. What image should my practice project: young and
dynamic, or established and conservative? Should the practice
mirror others in my region, or should it have a unique story and
an organization to match? These issues and others the start-up
financial planner must face are worked through in writing a busi-
ness plan.

The Business Plan

THE NEED FOR A BUSINESS PLAN
Financial planners are motivated by a desire to help people
achieve life goals. Like the plans they create to help others, a
good business plan will enable financial planners to achieve their
own life goals.
A business plan, like the scientific method, is both a process
and a tool. A rigorous approach to practice planning forces the
aspirant to temper enthusiasm with the harsh reality of making a
living without the resources and security of a big company. The
business plan forces us to think about the realism of our goals,
the depth of resources we need to build the practice, and most
important, the blueprint for achieving success.
The ultimate purpose of a business plan is to have a goal-
oriented, smooth-functioning, and lasting business. The first step
is to confirm that long-term personal goals are compatible with
the entrepreneurial style of a self-employed service provider. The
preparation of a business plan is somewhat like oral exams for a
Ph.D. The exam itself is not as much of a challenge as the prepa-
ration. If you can get through the planning process and not get
unnerved by the complexity of the task and the risk of going solo,
you have a very good chance to endure the first year of practice.
Thus, the business plan builds fortitude and self-confidence in
addition to producing a design for your practice infrastructure.

THE DO’S AND DON’TS OF A BUSINESS PLAN
◆ Do not use language that oversells your plan to yourself and to
the reader. Never use hyperbole: the terms _fantastic, exceptional,_


```

```
world class , and paradigm shift are substitutes for sound thinking
and are immediate alarms to the astute investor, partner, or
employee.
◆ Do use as few words as possible. Anyone can write a twenty-
five-page business plan, but only someone who understands the
essence of the practice-to-be can explain it in five pages.
◆ Do include numbers. A business plan springs to life when the
goals, strategies, and tactics are translated into believable num-
bers. Do the differentiating characteristics of the proposed prac-
tice support reasonable revenue growth and operating expense?
Is the magnitude of business revenue consistent with the target
population, products, and pricing? Spend some time explaining
the assumptions that underlie your financial data. This is a sure
way to add credibility to your calculations.
◆ Do answer all the likely questions from investors, partners, and
employees. Often, a simple, unresolved inconsistency in a business
plan can divert the reader’s attention from your message. Readers’
questions may include the following:
—Is your business idea unique?
—Is there a sufficient market for your specific service?
— Are your financial projections conservative yet adequate for
business growth?
— Do your experience and skills match the challenges of the busi-
ness plan?
```
```
ELEMENTS OF A BUSINESS PLAN
A business plan follows a logical sequence of topics from macro to
micro. The largest scale issue is the marketplace and competition.
The business plan starts from the market’s opportunities and chal-
lenges and closes with fine detail on steps to be taken to implement
the business. A business plan has the following elements.
— Executive summary: one page that explains why the business
will succeed
— Company description: a profile of the financial planning practice
— Industry analysis: market trends that make the business attractive
— Target market: who will buy the business’s products and services
—Competition: from whom you will take market share and why
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
— Marketing plan and sales strategy: the cycle beginning with
prospect awareness and resulting in revenue
— Operations: where the business will be located and equipped
— Management and organization: staffing
— Long-term development and exit plan: how the practice will
look at the point of maximum value
— Financial data: multiyear profit and loss (P/L) and cash flow
statements
—Appendix: supporting data
◆ Executive summary. This is the single most important _and_ most
difficult part of your business plan. A reader must easily grasp
the uniqueness, soundness, and potential of your business. The
executive summary must not the leave the reader with doubts. It is
your statement of vision, aspiration, and capability. If you cannot
prepare a clear, concise, and compelling condensation of your
business in one page, the reader will drag through the rest of
your plan. The executive summary persuades a reader to spend
time learning about you through words. State the mission of
your enterprise concisely and simply. Write the executive sum-
mary after you have completed the core of your business plan.
A good test of whether your business plan is clear is to have a
friend or colleague read your executive summary and repeat its
salient parts.
◆ Company description. Most business failures occur because
the principal misreads the market or disconnects with customers,
which illustrates a misperception of the business. The parameters
of the business must be clearly defined before effective marketing
can be planned. This section of the business plan states the basics:
company name, management titles, business location, product
and service package, fee structure, and legal form. This section
should also amplify the mission into the objectives and underlying
business principles of your company.
◆ Industry analysis. This section includes a description of the
overall financial services industry. Although you will not compete
with large, fully integrated investment and accounting firms, you
do need to consider how these large competitors operate and
how they could affect your business. Focus your thinking on the


```
Building the Practice Infrastructure
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
segment(s) of the industry defined by your products, services,
target clients, and geography. Carefully note which of those areas
could be expected to provide the most growth potential, given
your capabilities. Remember that in market segments with many
like competitors, entry is relatively easy, and competition is based
on price. Conversely, in market segments with a few dominant
competitors, entry is more difficult, and competition is based
upon differentiation. You need to decide whether you are going
to compete on price (and thus require a high volume of clients)
or differentiation (and thus need fewer clients). In the financial
services industry, with plenty of suppliers and distributors, the
cost of entry is lower, which is good. But your business plan must
address how you will stay in business.
◆ Target market. The type of customers you wish to work with will
determine your overall product and service mix and thus affect
your success. Moreover, if you are planning to use the business
plan to secure financing, defining the nature and size of your mar-
ket is a requirement. Bankers or backers want to know that there
is enough market available to allow you to compete. A tighter
market means more risk and more difficulty raising money. Mar-
ket research may also lead you to change your thinking about
advertising, packaging, location, sales structure, and even the
features and benefits of your service program.
◆ Competition. Every business has competition. There are
250,000 people who define their work as financial planning.
Seventy thousand, or 30 percent, have some type of financial
planning credential. Generally, the certified planner will have an
easier time attracting cold-call prospects. Practically, the creden-
tial is no guarantee of success. Respect your competitors. Do not
underestimate their ability or overestimate yours. Know what the
competition does well and what its weaknesses are.
Prepare a competitive table. Across the top, name the types
of financial planners you will compete against (or better, the
market leaders), ending with your company. Down the side, list
the important competitive characteristics that differentiate them:
price, reputation, professional network, experience, product/
service depth, business location, and so on. Within the grid,
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
mark the planners as high, moderate, or low competition with an
_H, M,_ or _L._ If your competition scores in the moderate to high
range, you will need a more potent competitive profile. Play your
strengths against your competitors and bolster your weaknesses.
◆Marketing plan and sales strategy. Marketing is designed
to increase client awareness and deliver an effective message
about your service. Sales strategy, on the other hand, is the
process of leveraging marketing to procure clients. Success-
ful marketing is the key to maintaining a steady flow of new
interest in your business during start-up. Referrals will take
over as your primary marketing tool once you are established.
Your marketing plan should define how you will make clients
aware of your service and what special message you are trying
to convey about yourself, your product, and your firm. Market-
ing does not need to be expensive or massive, but it should be
focused and disciplined. A more detailed description of how to
develop your marketing plan follows in Chapter 7.
◆Operations. Ten percent of success comes from a great idea.
Ninety percent of success comes from properly executing a great
idea. The operations section of your business plan explains how
you will implement your idea: the day-to-day functioning of your
company. Do not assume that the most basic business activities are
dull, unavoidable details. Each aspect of your business system is
worthy of evaluation and improvement. Spend time preparing a
basic standard operating procedures (SOP) manual. This manual
should describe the specific details of the processes by which you
produce, distribute, and maintain your services. Even though you
may start off alone, you will not want to take the time later to write
an SOP manual once employees come on board.
◆Management and organization. People inside the organization
ultimately determine your success. In fact, bankers and inves-
tors evaluate the business risk of a new venture based largely
on the strength of the people involved. Lenders often read the
management section of a business plan first. Carefully consider
the people you associate with your business. Whether advisory
board members, consultants, or employees, these people affect
your credibility. Some prospective clients may be impressed with


```

```

```
a large organization. However, the astute client knows that he or
she is paying for your overhead, not your thinking. Create as small
an organization as possible. Impress investors and prospects with
fewer, better people.
◆Long-term development and exit plan. What is your organi-
zation’s ultimate destination? How do you want your business
to look in five, seven, or ten years? This section of the business
plan helps you draw the road map to your destination personally,
professionally, and financially. Spell out specific terms you would
like to hear when your company is judged: community spirited,
best in the state, most often referred, most partners, high eth-
ics, good value, and so on. These milestones will help keep you
on track and let you measure your progress. In developing your
long-range plan, make sure logical annual steps or growth events
link to your end point.
◆Financial data. Many times this section is the toughest for
the planner. How can one realistically predict the future with
the accuracy of numbers? Yet, as mentioned before, all strong
business plans are definitive and measurable. Thus, you need to
come up with definitive and measurable results. This exercise has
two benefits. First, your assumptions about revenue (volume and
price) and operating expenses and collections (accounts receiv-
able) must fit together to yield profit and cash flow to sustain the
business. A good business plan is seen in the flow of the numbers
(and in the execution). Second, investors will want to hear you
talk about the financial data. A good marketing plan is made
stronger by an articulate financial summary.
The profit and loss statement (P/L) and sources and uses of
funds statement (cash flow) will reflect the quality of decisions
you have made and the impact of decisions you have laid out
in your plan. For example, your product/service portfolio and
pricing decisions are reflected in your revenue estimates. Your
advertising mix is reflected in your cost of operations. Your com-
pensation model and the quality of the customers you retain are
reflected in your cash flow. A third financial tool you will need is a
balance sheet. Your accountant (or accounting software package)
is the source of your financial data.
```

```

```
◆Appendix. The appendix should be designed to reinforce
the business plan’s content. Avoid giving too much detail in
the body of the text. Rather, the text should state your conclu-
sions and the reasons for them. The appendix should give the
specifics, the examples, and the background data sources that
support, confirm, or reinforce your conclusions throughout
the business plan.

Building Your Infrastructure

once you have completed your business plan and done a reality
check with trusted colleagues, you should turn to planning the
workings of the business: the infrastructure.

ESTABLISHING YOUR COMPENSATION STRUCTURE
Clients who see the need for engaging your services for personal
financial planning work will not be uncomfortable paying you
your worth. They know you are a professional and must be paid
for your expertise. The greatest problem you may encounter is
undervaluing your worth—in other words, charging too little.
Remember that your clients will not come around annually and
pay you the cost of a new plan. Rather, they will pay for this service
up front and will visit with you on an annual basis for a periodic
checkup or update. This update is minimal to the cost of the ini-
tial plan. Therefore, you must account for the importance of your
meeting with the client up front.
The compensation structure selected by a planner is often a
reflection of the type of practice provided. It represents an image,
both professional and personal, that is portrayed to the client. It
also represents the types of clients you wish to pursue. The com-
pensation structure should be addressed when you set up your
business, since you will commit to one method going forward. It
is not something that changes frequently. You will revisit the issue
periodically as your practice matures. But it is crucial to establish a
compensation structure from the beginning that you feel comfort-
able with. There are no right or wrong compensation methods.
The selected method must be evaluated on its merits for the type
of practice you desire to run. In your review, you will find yourself


```
Building the Practice Infrastructure
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
favoring some methods and not others. You may also feel that some
methods are more in line with your ethics than others. In any event,
you must focus on what you want to achieve from your practice.
There are five methods of compensation that financial plan-
ners can use to charge their clients. They are commission only, fee
only, fee based (fee and commission), fee offset, and assets under
management.
1 Commission. Planners working on commission receive payment
from a third party, usually an insurance or investment company.
The planner’s fee, of course, is bundled into the amount the client
pays the third party, but the actual payment comes directly from
the third-party vendor. The payment can take the form of a lump-
sum payment made at the time of sale to the client or of a long-
term “trailer,” in which the planner is compensated every time
the client makes a payment on the vendor’s product. Commission
payments can continue for many years. Some planners discourage
this form of compensation because it can skew a planner’s objec-
tivity and independence. However, the bottom line is doing what
is appropriate for the client, always and forever. Do that, and this
type of payment will not present a problem.
Many planners entering the financial planning business work
on a commission basis, because it is the easiest way to enter the
business and probably the quickest way to earn a living. Commis-
sions (whether alone or in combination with fees) still represent
the dominant form of compensation structure in the industry.
That is because its origins are in the insurance and stockbroker-
age industries, in which that mode of payment has been the most
common. Commissions make sense if you are providing specific
product recommendations and want to see the implementation
through. The payouts are large, and you can make a comfortable
living from your practice.
However, clients may perceive an inherent conflict of interest, since
your income stream is tied to purchases of product from you. Usu-
ally when planners have been in the business for a number of years,
they feel a desire to upgrade their practices away from commissions
for this reason. This task is difficult for most planners, because they
must deplete their income stream—those recurring commissions—
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
and go cold turkey until fees are earned. This approach could take
some time but may be worthwhile in the long run.
Transitioning to fees. For you to be successful in making a
transition with your existing clients, they must buy into the idea
of paying separately for a service that in their minds has been
received for free for many years (since the commissions received
by you were included as part of the payment they made to the
product sponsor). This is not to say that your clients did not real-
ize that they paid you. To the contrary, they recognized that but
probably paid little attention to it, because they were not writing
the check directly to you. They paid those premiums to the prod-
uct sponsor, who in turn paid you some of that money. Because
commissions are built into a life insurance premium or an invest-
ment product, many clients view them as a cost of doing business.
Making the transition to fees separates the money paid to you and
to the product company, and it can take months or even a year or
two for you to make a similar income through fees.
2 Fee only. Fees are direct charges to the client. They can take
one of two forms. In the first, the planner charges the client by
the hour (an hourly fee arrangement). For example, planners
typically charge anywhere from $100 to $400 per hour. You
should provide clients with an estimate of how much time you
will spend with them so that they can reasonably estimate the
fee. The second type is a flat fee that depends on scope of the
project (a flat-fee arrangement). For example, planners usually
charge $2,000 to $5,000 for a comprehensive financial plan. The
planner bases the fee on how many hours it will take to complete
the assignment. If the planner determines it will take ten hours
to put together a plan at $300 per hour, the flat fee is $3,000. If
the plan actually takes longer than ten hours to complete, the
planner should eat the difference and not underestimate the
time required for the project the next time it is undertaken.
Some planners prefer this method since it appears to eliminate
any conflicts of interest stemming from accepting payments on
product recommendations. Also, planners want to be thought of
as professionals—in the same light as CPAs and attorneys, who
generally have a fee-oriented practice.


```

```
How to charge for services is determined somewhat by what you
do for your clients. If your services are relatively uniform for all
clients, a formula fee works well. The formula can be based on any
number of factors, such as client income, investment assets, or net
worth. You may even base the fee on the complexity of the client’s
situation. The main advantage of this method is the simplicity of
determining a fee and the ease of billing. The main disadvantage is
that the formula can result in a fee that is grossly disproportionate
to the actual cost of delivering the service. If the formula results in
a fee that undercharges the client, then you can go broke. The flip
side is that you could unintentionally overcharge and eventually
lose a client due to the cost exceeding the value being received.
Charging by the hour works well when the services you provide
vary from client to client. The primary advantage is that you have
the ability to handle each of these different client situations. The
primary disadvantage is the effort involved in keeping time records
and the possibility that your clients may dispute a particular activ-
ity or the time recorded to complete your work for them.
Going fee-only is the trend in the profession. Because plan-
ners who practice on a fee basis feel no pressure to sell a prod-
uct, they may come across to the client as being more objective.
This professionalism makes them feel that they are doing a more
satisfactory job for the client. However, this payment structure is
not all positive.
For starters, it takes time to convert to a fee-only basis, and some
planners may argue that it is tough to make a living solely on this
compensation method. Another concern is that planners have lit-
tle incentive to see through the implementation of the plan since
they are not getting paid specifically for the follow-up. A third
drawback is the possibility that the total cost of doing the planning
for the client will be higher that what was initially quoted, espe-
cially if there is a commission earned by an outside party. You may
quote a fee and find that it is too low. You must honor your word,
however, because the client has trusted your professionalism and
expects to pay a set amount.
If you provide ongoing services for a client, you may want to
quote a periodic retainer. Just calculate the number of hours you
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
think you will spend at your normal billing rate. The fact that a
fee is earned for service rather than a commission eliminates an
apparent conflict of interest. Your clients may come to expect fees
for quality advice. This, however, is not always the case.
3 Fee and commission. A combination approach provides for you
to receive both fees and commissions from the client. It is easy
to double bill clients under this method. To avoid this problem,
make sure that services are completely separate and charge indi-
vidually for each.
The total amount of compensation you receive could be per-
ceived as being excessive to the client, because it appears that you
are paid twice for the same work: you get a fee for meeting with
the client and then receive monies on the recommendations you
suggested. You may view this differently, perhaps, since you are
getting paid for doing two separate jobs—that is, providing a plan
and receiving a commission for the implementation of an insur-
ance or investment product. It can also make you more alert to
the types of products available in the marketplace.
This double billing basically indicates that you want to be paid
for everything you do. Some professionals suggest avoiding this
approach since it tends to provide less value to the client and does
not work well to build long-term clientele.
4 Fee-offset. A fee-offset compensation program essentially
reduces the amount the client is ultimately responsible for paying
to the planner by substituting commissions paid by third-party
vendors for the client’s direct outlay of funds. For example, if the
planner charges the client $2,000 and the planner recommends
an insurance product that has an $800 commission to the plan-
ner, the planner then receives only $1,200 directly from the cli-
ent. The client pays the remaining $800 as a commission on the
insurance policy. The planner still receives the payment to com-
plete the work, yet the client gets a discount. This method usually
provides the best of both worlds for the planner and the client.
This approach is good if you want to guarantee yourself a certain
dollar amount from the client. In essence, you are providing the
recommendations and have included the pricing in your up-front
fee, so you know how much you are making at the outset of the


```
Building the Practice Infrastructure
```

```
engagement. It works for clients, because their fee is capped and
can even be reduced if they buy additional products you imple-
ment. They pay you the net amount (gross fees less commissions).
The downside is that this practice may not be legal in all states.
Some states consider this rebating and will not permit it. Check
with your state investment and/or insurance commissioner.
5 Assets under management. This type of compensation involves
receiving a payment from a client based on the assets under man-
agement or control. The planner is paid some percentage of the
assets or a flat fee for directing the client’s assets through several
investments, usually in a long-term arrangement. Many planners
charge their clients 1 percent as a management fee. If a client has
$1 million invested, the planner would receive an annual manage-
ment fee of $10,000. The fee is deducted from the client account
at the beginning of each quarter.
You can also charge for managing your clients’ assets if you like
receiving a quarterly annuity from your clients. This method pro-
vides you with the most stable income stream of any of the above
methods. Once you build an acceptable level, such as $10 million
under management, and charge a fee for managing those assets,
such as 1 percent, you can receive an income of $100,000 per year.
There is an increasing desire to move into this part of the pro-
fession because most planners believe that their clients lack the
expertise to properly allocate their own investments. If clients want
to reach their desired goals, such knowledge is critical. However,
many planners begin to focus on this area at the expense of other
vital financial planning areas. Nothing can be achieved on behalf of
your clients’ well-being if the insurance and cash flow arrangements
are not adequately planned first; only after these infrastructures are
in place would an asset management service be warranted.
However, this method does have its drawbacks. First, if your
clients have a substantial amount of assets in retirement accounts
or in real estate investments, these assets are outside the actively
managed accounts. You must consider these assets when doing
asset allocation, yet you may not be able to bill for actively manag-
ing these accounts. You may be able to get around that by charg-
ing a higher setup fee for these types of situations.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Second, if you promote return as a way to attract clients, your
practice will be short-lived. That is because it is nearly impossible
to outperform the market over the long term. What you need to
do instead is to manage your clients’ expectations effectively. Plan-
ners using this approach must provide value to clients by educat-
ing them that investing is a long-term process and not a quick fix,
which basically states to the client that you can pick and choose
the best investments for them and their investment goals. This
provides a safe harbor from fluctuating markets and keeps the
income stream intact.
Industry trend in compensation. The trend in the industry is
toward compensation through fees or assets under management.
Planners enjoy the responsibility of seeing their clients’ assets
grow. They enjoy selecting investments and taking a balanced
approach to the clients’ financial futures. Most planners start out
with small minimum balances, such as $100,000, and increase
those minimums as they obtain new clients. The problem then
often becomes one of time management—how to deal with all
the clients you represent. Planners can then limit whom they will
accept, for example, not taking on new clients without at least
$500,000 in investable assets.
These planners find it more cost-effective to bill at an hourly
rate for different levels of service rather than relying on the sale of
a product to cover those costs. For example, assume you work with
the client and charge a base fee of $1,700. You could allocate your
time to your coworkers and essentially cover their pay through cli-
ent billings as shown in the box at right.
Choosing the right compensation structure for your practice.
Since determining your compensation structure is so important,
you may not be ready for that decision right away. You may in fact
engage in some trial and error until you arrive at a method that is
both comfortable for you and fair to the client. Yet choosing the
right fee structure enables you to reasonably estimate how much
revenue the firm will take in, which is essential for growth and
expansion. You should continually revisit the issue, since economic
conditions may change or your practice may take a new direction.

CHOOSING YOUR LOCATION
In real estate and in business, it is often location that determines
value and success. Location, though to some a seemingly super-
ficial consideration, may be the most important aspect of any
business. The right location often depends on the type of prac-
tice you want and vice versa. Will you go after high-net-worth
clients? An office park might serve you well. Or will you serve
more modest-income clients? Consider a local shopping mall,
a converted residence zoned for business, or even your primary
residence. An office in a business townhouse development can
provide a homelike feel, rather than a pure business environ-
ment. It lends itself to clients stopping in unannounced to say
hello or catch up on today’s marketplace. Some planners view
a marble floor, big office building, and plush offices as signs of
being ultraprofessional. There is no right approach, other than
housing your office to fit your professional approach and your
personality.

BUILDING YOUR TEAM: INTERNAL STAFFING
Your practice is only as good as the people who run it. It is impossi-
ble for you to do everything required in a successful business. You
need to attract, hire, and retain the best people you can afford.
More simply, you cannot afford not to. If a job does not involve
presenting to clients, making investment decisions, or handling
significant client issues, delegate to staff members. Delegation
does not indicate you are losing control of your business. In fact,
it can mean you are more effectively controlling operations.
You will at least need an office manager who handles basic
accounting and key administrative tasks. Next to the professional,
the second most important person in a start-up is the office man-
ager. In new or small firms, the same person can do bookkeeping
and administrative tasks. For larger firms, it may be a good idea to
organize staff by specialties.
You may also want to consider a paraplanner. A paraplanner
operates like a paralegal. This trained assistant has completed
a basic financial planning course, ideally holds a certificate in
accounting, is skilled in spreadsheet preparation, and assists
the planner with back-office development. The paraplanner
inputs the data from the client interview worksheet, ensures
that the planner has easy access to stored information, makes
sure follow-up on client issues is provided in a timely fashion,
and answers general questions from prospects and clients. This
lets the planner concentrate on client contact and project man-
agement. The paraplanner is your right-hand person. He or
she must be confident solving client issues before they become
problems. For example, a paraplanner knows that when you
are meeting a client for the first time, you should have all the
information you need in advance. Your paraplanner should
think one step ahead of you, and good ones are worth their
weight in gold.
Delegation to a staff member can be performed consistently by
following standardized procedures. A procedures manual (see the
following section) outlining what gets done and why and who does
what and when provides for uniformity within the office.

HIRING STAFF
It is very difficult to find, hire, and retain the right staff. Adver-
tising is easy; however, predicting the success of an applicant in
your business is very hard. You, like all managers, will make hiring
mistakes. Your goal should be to keep errors to a minimum and
learn from each hiring experience.
◆ Searching. Where do you look for employees? Begin by con-
tacting the placement office at a local university or paraprofes-
sional institution. You can get access to very recent graduates and
alumni. Many placement offices have interns as well, who can
perform project assignments or work part-time. Second, call your
local Financial Planning Association (FPA) chapter. Many times
they have planners, paraplanners, students, and others who are
seeking work listed in a job bank. This is a good way to find quali-
fied help. Third, many CFP students are looking for practical on-
the-job training opportunities as well as cash for tuition and living
expenses. Use the many job websites to find candidates as well.
◆ Interview preparation. When you interview a job candidate,
you should prepare questions and answers in advance. It is fairly
easy to determine that a candidate has the technical skills you
seek. It is much more difficult to predict personal chemistry and a
candidate’s ability to work unsupervised while you are out selling.
The following queries will help you assess a potential employee’s
interest and ability.
— Have you worked in a service industry before? How did you like
it? What helped you to be successful?
—Why would you like to work in financial planning?
—What type of working environment do you like?
—Where do you see yourself five years from now?
— Do you like doing detail work on specific projects, or do you
prefer new projects with little definition?
—Do you enjoy dealing with clients?
—Do you enjoy telephone work?
—Are you able to travel on occasional overnight assignments?
—Describe yourself in three adjectives. How do others see you?
— What kind of compensation plan are you looking for (salary,
commission, bonus, or hourly)?
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ The interview. The purpose of the interview is to provoke dis-
cussions on the above questions and leave room for spontaneous
exchange. Your goal is to determine whether the individual (1) has
the skills necessary to become a contributing force within the office
and (2) will fit into the office environment today and tomorrow.
You will see the people you hire for forty hours every week, so think
carefully. Many planners emphasize whether someone will fit in
over depth of experience on the theory that skills can be taught but
personality is innate. Decide what criteria you will use, and develop
your own checklist of questions and responses to ensure that you
have a basis of comparison to make the best hiring decision.
◆ Making the decision. Are this person’s attitude and skills
relevant for the type of environment and practice you wish to
promote? After the initial screening process, bring in the most
qualified candidates for a group interview with the rest of the staff,
a consultant, or colleague with good staffing judgment. This pro-
vides a second opinion and lets the staff consider group chemistry.
Once a candidate has finished interviewing, assemble your team
and get immediate feedback. How does your current staff or col-
league feel about adding this person? Weigh your staff’s opinion
heavily; they will spend the most time with the new hire. For best
post-hire results make sure your staff has adequate input on the
new people who will affect their quality of work. Once you have
made your decision, draft an offer letter and mail or fax it to the
candidate. You should decide if you want the offer contingent on
references, background check, and health or drug test. Make sure
you tell all candidates up front about preemployment screening.
◆ Office procedures manual. An office procedures manual serves
two functions. First, it spells out exactly what your business does,
what needs to be done, and who needs to do it. Second, it serves
as a reference source for all client information. Client addresses,
phone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail information are incor-
porated into the document so that if a staff member needs to
look up client information, it can be found in this single source.
The document also defines office procedures from the first time
you correspond with a client to the first office visit to the delivery
of a financial plan.


```

```
For example, if you work from referrals, once the referred pros-
pect calls you, you send a prepackaged new client information kit.
This kit contains a client data form, a color brochure, SEC form
ADV, Part II (or similar NASD-required brochure defining your
investment advisory practice, if pertinent), a description of the
personal financial planning process, and biographical informa-
tion on the firm’s principals and staff. The manual describes how
to make a follow-up call to a prospect to set an appointment, how
to send a letter stating all the items the client should bring to the
office, and how to send a payment schedule. After the client comes
into the office for the preliminary interview stage (the first P of the
PIPRIM process discussed in Chapter 3), a staff person sends an
engagement letter. These procedures should be clearly spelled
out in the manual so any new staff member can easily understand
them and implement them with minimal assistance.
◆ Using consultants. Sometimes it makes sense to outsource work.
In fact, the Trendsetter Barometer survey conducted by Coopers &
Lybrand, LLP, shows that 83 percent of America’s fastest-growing
companies have turned to outsourcing for one or more functions.
The benefits of outsourcing can be significant. First, it is less costly.
Consultants do not receive benefits and need not be paid during
slow periods. Second, a specialty consultant can help you solve
immediate problems, expand your reach to prospects, and acquire
new skills for the staff. Third, outsourcing can allow you to handle
work overflow. If business becomes very brisk, a consultant can be
the difference between accepting and declining work.
However, there can be problems with outsourcing. First, the
cost of hiring a specialist is usually higher per project or per hour
than that of a full-time worker. Second, consultants may not be
available if you need things done in a hurry, because they are con-
stantly looking for and working on other jobs.
◆ Staff compensation. How can you pay your staff competitively,
promote teamwork, and reward individuals for outstanding
efforts? Talented employees who are not satisfied with compensa-
tion and/or work conditions tend to perform the minimum and
never get to the creative problem solving and innovation you need
to grow your support organization along with your business. If you
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
assume your office operation is simply administrative, procedural,
and repetitive then you need people and compensation to match.
However, if you are looking for an office team that can grow
with your business plan, search for new ways to serve clients, and
improve operations, then you need a different employee profile
and compensation plan. The more dynamic the business plan, the
more dynamic the organization and compensation plan.
Compensation thus depends largely on the type of work your
employees will do. Ideally, as noted previously, you and the princi-
pals will manage face-to-face relations with clients, design financial
products, and implement marketing tactics. The balance of activi-
ties will be the domain of your office staff. You will have to oversee
and delegate at the same time. This delicate balance can be very
difficult, if not frustrating. A shift to either end of the continuum
can mean loss of control or too much control. Clear task defini-
tions and performance standards are the best ways to insure con-
sistency. Here are the tasks your office staff should manage:
—Computerized client information system
—Client contact program
—New client proposal preparation
—Office equipment needs assessment and maintenance
—Central calendar management
—Telephone inquiries from prospects
—Behind-the-scenes problem solving
—Implementation of direct marketing programs
—Accounts receivable

Some of the most important work your office staff will manage
will be client confidential. State or federal licensing may require
some information and client functions to be held confidential.
However, you must decide who on your staff will have access to what
information. It is much more difficult to remove access to informa-
tion than to set restrictions from the beginning. Take time to con-
sider sensitive issues in your business plan.
Compensation models should include base pay and some sort
of incentive for personal excellence and business success. With
this notion in mind, here are some common approaches:


```
Building the Practice Infrastructure
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
— Administrative assistant: base salary of $25,000 to $35,000 and
annual incentive bonus of 5 to 7 percent of base salary
— Office manager (oversees administrative assistants and part-time
staff): base salary of $50,000 to $75,000 and annual incentive of
7 to 10 percent of base salary
— Salesperson: base salary of $20,000 to $25,000 and commission
of 100 to 110 percent of base salary on a sliding scale linked to
sales growth
— Fee-only financial planning support: base salary of $35,000 to
$50,000
```
```
The compensation models you choose will depend on the
profile of the staffing your business plan requires, competition
for staffing, and your compensation and ability to pay. The more
dynamic your compensation design, the better the quality of peo-
ple you will attract and retain. Structure your plan so compensa-
tion grows with personal and business success.
```
```
DEVELOPING A BUSINESS ADVISORY BOARD
The details involved in setting up your business can occupy
too much attention. You need to keep your focus on the larger
issues at the same time. One of the larger and enduring issues is
the implementation of your mission. It is very difficult to blend
the big picture with the details of starting a professional services
business. An advisory board of complementary professionals can
give you what they have learned about how to balance the short
term and long term. The entrepreneur will make mistakes. An
advisory board will reduce the mistakes and mitigate the conse-
quences.
Your board is a reflection of you and vice versa. Select the best
people you can attract. In doing so your business plan will receive
instant credibility and will improve over time. Why would top peo-
ple in marketing, banking, or general management want to help
you? First, not because you are a good salesperson. Quality board
members do not want to be “sold” a business plan. Most often
board members are dedicated friends, established businesspeo-
ple who enjoy being mentors, or people who want to add board
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
membership to their own experience base. You do not need to
compensate board members. An annual dinner, social outing,
mention in a community newspaper press release, or biographi-
cal mention in a professional practice information brochure are
ways to thank your board.
Your advisory board should be small enough to meet regu-
larly but large enough to represent the disciplines you need
to guide you. Seek people with recognized skills and a record
of success in direct marketing, general management, financial
products, and banking as a start. The above blend of profes-
sional expertise would create a board of five members includ-
ing you. If possible, try to include one person who is outside
your region. This will bring a more “global” perspective to your
practice.
Your advisory board should meet once a month for an hour
during the first year to follow the implementation of your busi-
ness plan and help you anticipate problems and opportunities.
Your out-of-state board member can be teleconferenced into
the meetings. Another option is to alternate formal sessions with
breakfast meetings to discuss immediate issues needing guidance.
A subset of your board could meet to discuss marketing, collec-
tions policy, or financing. Always prepare an agenda for the board
so they can think about how to help you.
At the first advisory board meeting, focus the discussion on
the mission of the company and the business plan. At later
meetings, select one central theme to explore and resolve.
Meetings should always be close-ended, meaning an action
plan has been created. In January focus on client service, Feb-
ruary on pricing, March on alternative distribution channels,
and so on. When critical issues come up, like a supplier going
out of business or a new competitor in the area, call for an
impromptu meeting, fax or e-mail your thoughts to the mem-
bers, and solicit ideas. Your advisory board is motivated to see
you succeed: do not be concerned about _over_ working them, do
be aware of _under_ working them.

Interdependence of the Business Plan
and Business Infrastructure
```
```
if the business plan is the heart of your enterprise, the infra-
structure is the brain, arms, and legs of your enterprise. Each
depends on the other for a thriving organism. Creating the busi-
ness plan forces you to think your idea through to the details. It is
the blueprint you, your investors, your board, and your employees
will use to measure progress. No business can succeed without a
plan, because no entrepreneur can know how to react to busi-
ness problems and opportunities fast enough to make the right
choices. Business plans help managers anticipate and prepare for
the future with logical, resource-efficient contingencies. Although
you may want to surprise your competitors, you do not want to
surprise your investors, clients, or accountant with unanticipated
business setbacks. Prepare for the worst and work for the best.
EXHIBIT 6.1 presents a sample business plan. This simple plan
provides a model or starting point for preparing your mission and
strategy and for what to include in the plan (see pages 206–213).
Following the body of the plan, the appendix will include sup-
porting information; market research citation; assumptions about
economic and population trends; calculations used in your income
statement, such as revenue growth; and so on. The appendix should
include new information unrelated to the business plan. Rather, it
should clarify, support, or reinforce the arguments and statements
you make in your business plan. Detailed information about share-
holders, advisory board members, and employees should also be
included here. You may elect to explain the rationale for your busi-
ness strategies, previously summarized in the plan, and explain why
alternative approaches were evaluated and rejected. This shows the
reader, and most important, potential investors, that you openly
and competently evaluated your business plan. However, do not
depend on your appendix to explain your business plan. Many
astute investors will try to make a “no” judgment after the first page
and reserve “yes” until they have analyzed the entire plan, inter-
viewed the principals, and checked the numbers.

Financial Planning Company Business Plan

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
◆ Company description. Financial Planning Company (FPC) is a
Colorado-based company providing fee-based financial planning
services to individuals. Sixty percent of the firm’s stock is owned
by Brian Jones and 40 percent of the company’s stock is owned by
Nancy Mandone.
◆ Mission statement. FPC’s mission is to provide fee-based finan-
cial planning services to individuals with incomes between $50,000
and $100,000. The firms will generate income from financial prod-
ucts provided to clients and from financial information service sub-
scriptions over the Internet.
◆ Products and services. FPC provides fee-based comprehensive
and modular financial planning services for middle-income clients.
Hourly fees of $150 are billed to clients. Financial plans generally
take twelve hours to complete. FPC is also licensed to receive
insurance and securities commissions from sales of recommend-
ed products.
◆ Target markets. FPC will target the Greater Denver metropoli-
tan area. Metro Denver has a population base of over 2.3 million
persons of which 50 percent are in the $50,000 to $100,000
income range.
◆ Marketing and sales strategy. FPC will differentiate itself from
other financial planning firms by educating its client base to become
more aware of financial planning issues and by providing added
value information services.
◆ Competitors and market distribution. There are sixty providers
of fee-based financial planning services in the Denver metropolitan
area. Thirty are solo practices, ten are multiple-partner single-
location practices, and ten are multiple-location firms.
◆ Competitive advantages and distinctions. FPC’s major competi-
tive advantage is its ongoing educational approach. By educating
prospects to make the right choice in financial strategies and
financial assistance, FPC will attract a higher quality clientele with


```

```
long-term relationship potential. FPC will be the first firm to offer an
interactive website that allows prospects to assess their readiness
for financial assistance, and presells FPC’s solutions. In addition,
the firm intends to expand its practice locations to provide “neigh-
borly” service compared to the “downtown” image of competitors.
◆ Management. President Brian Jones has been a practicing finan-
cial planner for more than fifteen years. He specializes in working
with middle-income families and their concerns.
◆ Operations. FPC conducts business at 123 Jefferson Street,
Denver, Colorado.
◆ Financials. Annual revenue projections for the current year are
$250,000. In 2006, we expect revenue to surpass $350,000. In
2007, we expect revenue to exceed $500,000.
◆ Long-term goals. FPC’s long-term goals are to open an office in
Colorado Springs in 2006, Fort Collins in 2007, Greeley in 2008,
and Phoenix in 2009. Each location will be managed by an equity
partner.
◆ Funding and exit strategy. FPC will require initial capitalization
of $170,000 for year one. These operating funds will be attained
through commercial notes secured by the principal’s assets. The
owners of FPC expect to sell 70 percent of their equity to new part-
ners by 2010.
```
```
COMPANY DESCRIPTION
◆ Company mission. FPC’s mission is to be the leading “neighbor-
hood” fee-based financial planning service for middle-income clients
earning $50,000 to $100,000.
◆ Services. FPC provides comprehensive and modular planning
services for a flat fee. When appropriate, the firm may also rec-
ommend and sell various investment and insurance products. FPC
will retain an ongoing relationship with clients, with whom FPC
will meet at least once a year. The firm will also perform hourly
financial planning services for clients with specific and immedi-
ate finan cial needs. FPC will also offer an affordable, value-added
financial services newsletter, free to clients and subscription to
the gen eral public. The newsletter will be printed as well as an
Inter net product.
```

◆ Legal status. FPC is a Colorado-based company providing fee-
based financial planning services to individuals. Sixty percent of
the company’s stock is owned by Brian Jones and 40 percent of
the company’s stock is owned by Nancy Mandone, a nonoperating
partner. FPC is a Subchapter S corporation.

INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
FPC will be well positioned to take advantage of the significant
opportunities presented by the intergenerational transfer of wealth.
With $6 trillion dollars expected to change hands over the next ten
years, FPC sees the need for retirement and estate planning ser-
vices for people who may be intimidated by financial planning or may
think such services are not affordable. FPC has not seen other fee-
based financial planning firms taking the education-first approach
toward working with neighborhood communities.
◆ Barriers to entry. Many planners in the Denver market are sell-
ing the same products and services, competing on a price basis
with high center-city overhead. The “commoditization” of the market
could mean confused and underserved consumers, intense price
competition, and shrinking margins. Consumers are likely to want
more service from their advisers rather than the same service at a
lower price. FPC’s strategy will be to attract prospects with an edu-
cational approach to personal financial management and to retain
clients with complementary financial information giving helpful hints
to increase buying power.
◆ Current environment. The current environment supports the
need for additional fee-based financial planners entering this mar-
ketplace. With 130 million households in the United States and
approximately 100,000 licensed or registered financial planners,
the ratio of targets to planners is 1,300 to 1. Thus, the market is
far from saturated. Assuming the Denver market reflects national
demographics, there are many consumers who will need FPC’s help.
Focusing on the vast middle- to upper-middle-income market, FPC will
have a growing market to tap.
◆Long-term opportunities. Short- and long-term growth potential for
FPC appears very positive. We expect that consumers will rec ognize
the value and accept the additional expense of working with licensed

```
financial planners and will respond to FPC’s educational approach to
promoting the importance and ease of professional assistance.
```
```
TARGET MARKET
FPC will target households in the Greater Denver metropolitan area
that fit the following profile:
—Head of household age: thirty-five to sixty
—Income range: $50,000 to $100,000
—Occupation: small business owners, professionals, salespeople
—Location: Metro Denver
—Socially and environmentally responsive
—Family and generationally oriented
—Internet capable
```
```
COMPETITION
FPC’s primary competitors include the following fee-based financial
planning firms:
— PTH Financial: 1998 start-up, one downtown office, investment-
services focus
— Denver Planning Associates: 1985, suburban location, bilingual,
retirement-planning focus
— CKP Services: 1973, two locations downtown, full service, well
regarded, not marketing
— Johnson Financial Planning: 1997, one suburban location, full
service, multigeneration focused
— Aspen Planning: 1991, affiliated with Aspen Real Estate Associ-
ates, investment-planning focus
```
```
FPC recognizes the strengths, weaknesses, and resiliency of
these major competitors. The firm does not intend to target their
current customer base but rather pursue the untapped market of
consumers who have resisted, overlooked, or shied away from
professional services. FPC intends to educate its clients to select
appropriate investments to meet long-term goals and objectives.
◆ Market share. None of the competitors listed above has sig-
nificant market share. This is due to the large number of fee-based
financial planning firms in the marketplace.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
◆ Competitor strengths. FPC’s major competitors have excelled in
the following areas:
— A total of twelve salespeople soliciting prospects. No single firm
has more than three salespeople.
— Several firms have affiliations with local accounting, legal, and
investment firms. These relationships provide clients with ready
access to complementary professional services.
— Several owners are prominent in local environmental issues,
school boards, and community service. These commitments add
credibility and access to new targets.
◆ Competitor weaknesses. FPC’s major competitors have neglected
the following opportunities:
— The Internet: No firm uses the Internet for interactive communica-
tion with prospects or clients, although several have websites.
— Community focus: The more established firms promote their
upscale, downtown location, which attracts high-income pros-
pects but ignores the needs of middle-income individuals and
families.
— Pricing: Most competitors follow the same pricing scheme,
offering free initial consultations, various forms of money-back
guarantees, and referral incentives. This motivates prospects to
think price, not value. Although FPC recognizes the attraction of
price, the firm will strive to attract fewer but more loyal clients
with long-term family needs.

MARKETING PLAN AND SALES STRATEGY
FPC intends to attract prospects and retain clients through the fol-
lowing marketing and sales approaches:
— Press releases: Business founding and advisory board formation,
community events, staffing appointments, and promotions
— Brochures: Professional services brochures, special topic litera-
ture
— Consumer events: Shopping center openings, community social
events, seniors’ events, civic group meetings
—Direct mail
— Newspaper advertising and articles in special supplements
(retirement planning, education planning, and estate planning)

— Internet: Interactive website allowing prospects to answer a ten-
question financial profile, ask a “wizard” questions about finan-
cial planning, and communicate directly with the firm via e-mail

```
OPERATIONS
FPC operates from 123 Jefferson Street, Denver, Colorado. FPC
also maintains an electronic location at its Web-based customer
training center. This virtual center makes it easy for clients to
access our financial information and services products from home.
We believe the Internet offers prospects a low-risk method requiring
low commitment to learn about financial planning and FPC. Further,
the training center lets prospects and clients pose questions to FPC
professionals in a chat-room environment.
```
```
MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION
FPC President Brian Jones has been a practicing financial planner
for more than fifteen years. He specializes in working with middle-
income families and their concerns. He is a graduate of Hofstra Uni-
versity and is a CPA. FPC intends to hire an office manager in year
one and a salesperson in year two and build a clientele in target
suburban locations.
```
```
LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT AND EXIT STRATEGY
FPC will grow steadily over the next five years. By 2010, FPC plans
to have a 5 percent market share of families with incomes between
$50,000 and $100,000 who today are not using professional plan-
ning services.
◆ Strategy for achieving goals. FPC will consider accepting part-
ners in the Denver area and selling franchises in particular loca-
tions in the United States with demographics similar to those of the
Denver area.
◆ Risks. The greatest risks of expansion are the chance of diluting
FPC common stock and the fixed costs associated with increasing
the number of FPC offices.

The Nature of Marketing and Sales

in the previous chapter you saw how to prepare a

business plan and build a practice infrastructure. In

short, you were introduced to _spending_ money to get

your business going. In this chapter, the art of _mak-_

_ing_ money is introduced: marketing and sales. Making

money the right way is an art. Almost anyone can adver-

tise, put a sign on the front door, and start a business.

MARKETING

YOUR

PRACTICE

##### CHAPTER 7


```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Marketing and sales is the process of attracting the right custom-
ers with the right message and the right products and services.
The proof of marketing success is client growth and retention.
How are these measured?
◆ Increasing prices. Have you been successful in increasing your
prices for the same product or service over time? If so, this means
you have provided more value to customers for the same products
and services than your competitors have.
◆ Increasing margin per client. Are you leveraging your market-
ing investment in new clients such that it costs less over time to
attract and retain customers? If so, this means you have used an
effective mix of marketing tools to get your message across to the
right customers.
◆ Increasing referrals. Are you getting an increasing number of
unsolicited inquiries about your firm? While you cannot be sure
that new inquiries come from satisfied customers or are driven
by advertising, you will know something is wrong if no one calls.
You should have your front-office staff track new inquiries care-
fully and note call rates before and after promotional events. If
the incoming call rate is increasing each month and positive blips
occur around the time of a promotional event—usually within
thirty to sixty days—then you are getting the combined benefit of
word of mouth and marketing.
◆ Increasing retention. One can argue that client retention is a
function of the quality, value, and ongoing care you provide to
your clients. However, client retention is also a function of your
ability to design and communicate new products and services.
The speed with which new products and services are adopted by
clients is a measure of your marketing acumen.

What Is a Marketing Plan?

marketing is the process of finding and creating customers for
your products and services. Sales is the process of transforming
an interested prospect into a committed client. Your marketing
plan is a written document that describes your targets, your mes-
sage, the ways you plan to communicate your message, the costs
involved, and the expected results. In essence, a marketing plan


```
Marketing Your Practice
```

```
is a road map that helps you figure out the best way to reach your
clientele. It helps you to understand your business thoroughly
by requiring you to think and write about how to differentiate
your services. If your message is not clear and different from the
competition, no amount of hard work will yield increasing prices,
margin per client, referrals, and retention.
A marketing plan should be easy to comprehend, easy to fol-
low, and based on a logical sequence of steps. Almost anyone—
prospect or friend—should be able to understand, recite, and
follow your plan. Ask your advisory board to add a professional
touch to any rough edges or to mention opportunities you may
have overlooked.
```
```
Elements of a Marketing Plan
your marketing plan will be a subsection of your overall busi-
ness plan (see Chapter 6). Use the following basic elements to
organize your thinking on marketing your start-up professional
financial planning practice.
◆ Executive summary
◆ Market analysis and objectives
◆ Developing marketing targets: attracting prospects, turning
prospects into clients, retaining clients, building referrals, and
niche positioning
◆ Developing marketing tactics: understanding the four Ps
◆ Creating strategic alliances
◆ Marketing budget
◆ Action plan
◆ Auditing the results: quantitative methods (keeping a score-
card) and qualitative methods (client satisfaction survey)
```
```
Executive Summary
the purpose of the executive summary here is the same as in
the business plan. It provides the reader a succinct, cohesive
overview of the rationale, tactics, cost, and expected results of
the marketing plan. As with the executive summary of your busi-
ness plan, the opening section of your marketing plan must con-
vince the reader of the logic and probability of the marketing
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
plan. The reader will not go further into the plan if the execu-
tive summary does not hold together. Here are the common
pitfalls of an executive summary:
◆ Market opportunity is too narrow to build a business or too
large to effectively compete. For example, providing mutual fund
investment consulting is too narrow as well as being adequately
served by other professions.
◆ Target market is too vague, too large, or too small. A descrip-
tion of a target audience of consumers “ in need,” or consumers
with gross incomes over $50,000, or consumers with disposable
incomes of 15 percent to 20 percent of gross, is ill-defined.
◆ Market messages are too loud. There is a tendency to over-
whelm the marketplace with noise rather than message. People
tune out noise—aimless slogan marketing—and tune in crisp
messages that align with real consumer needs.
◆ Marketing tactics are grandiose. It is very easy for an entre-
preneur to feel so strongly about his or her business idea that
emotion overrules marketing spending. Take, for example, the
majority of dot-com companies in the late 1990s. Many of these
companies billed themselves as having great potential—only to
realize losses into the early 2000s. Ultimately, many ended up
going out of business. The lesson here is not to make big promises
early on; they may not pan out.
◆ Marketing results are not measurable. Ask a marketing man-
ager to design a method to measure results, and you often hear
groans and complaints. It is easy to get lulled by the hype and
forget that marketing competes for company resources like any
other investment. Return-on-investment analysis (ROI) is just as
necessary for marketing as it is for adding another planner to
your staff.
As suggested in Chapter 6 in reference to the business plan,
write the marketing executive summary after the rest of the plan
has been completed. You will maintain a better overall perspec-
tive after having defined the details.

Market Analysis and Objectives

```
analyzing the market and setting objectives make up one of
two core sections in your marketing plan, the other being deter-
mining your marketing tactics. In this section, you describe very
simply why your company should exist. What is the market oppor-
tunity that current suppliers of financial planning services have
failed to satisfy? What business do you want to be in? For example,
a colleague in the clinical laboratory business has pointed out
that his business is not running diagnostic tests on blood and
urine samples. His business is providing medical information to
improve patient quality of life.
Your mission statement is the starting point for marketing. It
should describe why your organization will exist—what purpose
it will serve. Later in your marketing plan you will take the next
step and explain how your firm will fill this void permanently
and profitably.
How do you conduct market analysis and arrive at market-
ing objectives for your practice? The first step is to do a needs
assessment. Within your mission, what are the needs in the mar-
ketplace, both satisfied and unsatisfied? Make a list of financial
planning needs of major consumer groups that are adequately
satisfied with high-quality service and at a fair price in your region.
These are the areas you will want to avoid initially. Why go after
satisfied customers when there are so many that are not satisfied?
Now make a second list of consumers whose needs you believe are
not being satisfied. Who are these people, and what do they want?
How do you find out? Ask your colleagues in allied professions:
law and accounting. Look for articles and syndicated columns on
personal finance in newspapers and magazines. Listen to radio
talk shows. The more homework you do, the more tightly defined
your market analysis will be.
Next, how do you quantify unsatisfied needs? This means deter-
mining how many people in your geographic capture area have
the financial planning needs you have identified. This task is very
difficult and unscientific. First you need to develop a demograph-
ic profile of your capture area. Your capture area is defined as the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
region or regions you plan to serve. This may be determined by a
distance from your office—for example, within a 100-mile radius.
It may include municipalities or communities that surround your
office, perhaps ten areas you know. Starting with a rough map of
your territory, you need to find out how many people live in the
capture area and what percentage of these people might have
the unsatisfied needs you have identified. Your local reference
librarian can help you with census information. Also, try one of
the Internet search engines to research demographics. Your state
department of human resources, which typically gathers demo-
graphic information, may have a website.
Once you have an estimate of the people living in your capture
area, how many could be interested in fulfilling the unsatisfied
financial planning needs you have targeted? This is where any
notion of scientific inquiry ends. You simply will not know until
you start to ask. However, it is possible to sketch the population
you are trying to reach. If your needs assessment suggests that
people have sophisticated and multifaceted financial planning
needs, then education level and income may be relevant markers
to measure. If your needs assessment suggests an opportunity for
working with medium-income families who do not have a financial
adviser, look at areas where there are no brokerage firms, commu-
nity newspapers do not carry advertisements for CPAs, and savings
and loan associations are common. These areas are likely to be
populated with a higher concentration of people meeting your
income and education profile. But how many of these people will
want the unique services you think will fill a void?
In Chapter 6 it was estimated that there are some 1,300 families
to every financial planner in the United States. If this suggests an
underserved national market, then your capture area should have
about the same ratio. If there are ten major competitors in your
capture area (defined by specific demographics and geography),
you would all share a market potential of 13,000 families to be
consistent with the national ratio. Since you are not national, how
many families are there statistically in your capture area? Assume
your library work leads to an estimate of about the same number
in your local market. Then your capture area is underserved as


```
Marketing Your Practice
```

```
well. How many of these 13,000 families do you need to win in
year one to fulfill your business plan? (Note: 13,000 families
would be about 45,500 people, the population of a medium-
sized suburban town or community.) Here, you work backwards
from your revenue goals. In your business plan you have already
assumed a revenue goal for year one. This was logically based on
an estimate of the number of prospects you can turn into clients
times an average fee per client. If you assumed one hundred cli-
ents in year one, what percentage penetration of the total capture
area would that be? This would equal less than 1 percent of the
market (100/13,000 = .008). In general, you should estimate no
more than 1 percent market penetration no matter how unique
your product or service or how clever your marketing plan. One
percent of 13,000 families is one hundred thirty available cus-
tomers, and that would leave you room to increase your business.
Fewer available families would mean more competition, pressure
for higher differentiation, and more expensive marketing.
Remember, this long calculation is based on many assumptions
and is only a starting point, a rough estimate. You would be wise
to visit the communities you plan to serve to hand out a short and
simple prestamped survey to quantify local needs. Look for signs
of unsatisfied need in local newspaper articles, ask friends and
colleagues, listen to the radio—in other words, keep your market
research radar operating all the time.
```
```
What About the Competition?
the market analysis above assumes a static competitive environ-
ment. Do not expect the established competitors to welcome you
to their market. The best way to solidify your market research
estimates is to do a SWOT analysis.
```
```
SWOT ANALYSIS
Assessing your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
is a method to determine how your company (defined by your
business plan) is likely to fare against competition. The goal is to
predict where your company will excel and where you may have
trouble competing.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
A list of comparative strengths will help you plan a differen-
tiation strategy, while a list of weaknesses shows you where you
may have to make adjustments and investments in strategy. A list
of competitive threats and opportunities may help you predict
how and when your competitors will respond to your entering
the market. Look at the top three or four competitors’ strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and have a contingency
plan ready in case they decide to outmarket you. The size of your
capture market is directly related to the degree of advantage your
competitors allow. Strike early.
EXHIBIT 7.1 (see pages 239–240) is an example of a SWOT analysis
for Financial Planning Company (FPC). The management of FPC
would use this SWOT analysis to build a contingency marketing plan
to respond to competitive threats and opportunities as they may
emerge in the future. In your own marketing planning, if you feel
the probability of a competitive action to be extremely high, do not
wait; take preemptive action. In the case of FPC, the owners should
launch their Internet site but have second- and third-generation
technology ready to implement by the end of year one.

Marketing Objectives

your marketing objectives define the strategy and tactics you
will follow to create demand for your products and services. This
demand will result, ideally, in the revenue growth numbers in
your business plan. Marketing objectives should be organized
in the following three categories: (1) marketing outcomes,
(2) targets, and (3) communication tactics.
Setting marketing objectives for your firm is analogous to
helping your clients establish their financial objectives through
PIPRIM, as presented in Chapter 3. Use the same process to think
through your marketing objectives.

EXAMPLES OF MARKETING-OUTCOME OBJECTIVES FOR FPC
◆ Reach 50 percent of the capture population with an impres-
sion of FPC as the community financial planning service for East
Denver–area families by the end of year one (assume 50,000
families x .5 = 25,000 families).


```
Marketing Your Practice
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
◆ Motivate 10 percent of the families reached by FPC’s marketing
message to inquire about financial planning services by the end of
year one (25,000 families x .10 = 2,500 families).
◆ Convert 5 percent of inquiries into clients by the end of year
one (2,500 families x .05 = 125 families).
```
```
EXAMPLES OF TARGET OBJECTIVES FOR FPC
◆ Build a demographic profile of three communities in East
Denver by the end of the second month of year one.
◆ Prepare a list of 25,000 families within the three East Denver
communities by the end of the third month of year one.
◆ Schedule a public financial planning presentation in each of
the three target communities in the first six months of year one.
```
```
EXAMPLES OF COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES FOR FPC
◆ Prepare a cover letter and professional brochure to promote
the community financial services message to middle-income fami-
lies who have no experience with professional planners. Complete
mailing by fourth month of year one.
◆ Interview and hire a freelance Web designer to set up a first-
generation website with e-mail question-and-answer capability by the
end of the third month of year one. Complete the design for second-
and third-generation websites by the ninth month of year one.
```
```
Developing Marketing Targets
who are the target audiences you are trying to reach, convert,
and retain? What message are you trying to communicate to these
target groups? In general, there are four categories of people you
want to reach: prospects, inquirers, existing clients, and referrals.
```
```
PROSPECTS
Prospects are, by definition, consumers who do not know that
you exist and may not think they need planning products and
services. This group is the faceless public. You know they are out
there, but you cannot distinguish them. Promoting your firm to
this group is classic shotgun marketing. It requires a very general
message, stated in common and unintimidating words. Here are
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
four simple rules on how you can attract prospects.
1 Position yourself as a specialist. You cannot be all things to all
people. It is virtually impossible to keep up-to-date in all planning
areas. You are destined to become a specialist. Get very good at one
aspect of financial planning and make yourself known as the firm
that specializes. There is more demand for an adviser who is the
best on a specific topic—such as retirement, investments, insur-
ance, or income tax—than for a generalist who gives up high-
margin business to a specialist. Consider the planner who enjoys
working with seniors. Seniors have wealth, have the time to get
involved, and know many other people with similar financial needs.
One planner decided to dedicate his practice to clients fifty years
old and over who are AARP members. He then immersed himself
in the issues concerning older adults: Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, early retirement options, estate-planning matters, health
insurance, fear of aging, and other issues affecting quality of life.
He is now an expert on the needs of this special group and is in
high demand for speaking engagements. He is known among
seniors in his capture area as the first call to make for help.
2 Differentiate yourself from your competition. Make sure con-
sumers see your services as different from those of competitors.
Positioning yourself as a specialist will help to do this. So will tak-
ing an inventory of opinion in your capture area. Ask people the
following questions:
—What would make you visit a financial planner?
—Do you believe a financial planner can assist you?
— What would motivate you to place your finances in the hands of
a professional planner?
3 Package your services to meet the specific needs of your tar-
get market. You may decide to bundle your services in a way that
encompasses all the primary needs of your chosen market. For
example, if you provide a comprehensive financial plan, income
tax return preparation, and money management services all for
one price, that might attract more clients. Most consumers appre-
ciate one-stop shopping, including for financial services. You can
still price your services individually for clients who wish to pur-
chase them separately.


```
Marketing Your Practice
```

```
4 Reevaluate your position regularly. Never be satisfied with
where you are professionally. Complacent advisers do not expand
their businesses or change with the times. Imagine if General
Electric never made anything but washing machines, or IBM
never expanded beyond the mainframe computer. Merrill Lynch
is challenging its traditional broker distribution system by employ-
ing the Internet to transact customer business. Along with your
clients, you, too, will need to change with the times.
```
```
once you know what you want to say to prospects, consider how
you are going to reach them. Direct mail and seminars are two
cost-effective methods.
◆ Reaching prospects with direct mail. There are so many
people in the prospect category that you are forced to blanket a
community with a single message and hope enough people will be
attentive. Direct mail, the most common prospecting tool, usually
generates a 3 percent to 5 percent response rate. You can maxi-
mize your response rate by adhering to a few simple principles:
—Deliver one message and repeat it often.
—Make the reader feel competent, not stupid, about taking action.
—Use pictures of friendly people helping friendly people.
—Use color in the text to amplify your key point.
—Deliver your message in less than one minute of reading time.
— Make it easy for the reader to respond: include a tear-off card
or an 800 number.
— Ask the reader to pass the information on to a friend or family
member.
◆ Reaching prospects with seminars. Seminars are presentations
made to a group of prospects who have similar interests and
needs. These workshops can vary in length from fifteen minutes
to eight hours and can come in a variety of formats, from live
presentations to audio/phone teleconferences. Seminars are
successful if they generate appointments from participants who
want to find out more about the topic. Seminars are also success-
ful if they help you build a trusting relationship with prospects,
some of whom will get to know you and a few of whom will seek
your services. Those trusting relationships also give rise to refer-
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
rals (as explained below), the ultimate revenue ticket.
Seminar participants should experience comfort, understand-
ing, respect, emotional uplift, and the desire to change.
_Comfort._ Do the participants like you? Are they threatened by
what you have to say and therefore feel uncomfortable? If so,
they may never come to trust you enough to become clients.
People generally do business with people they like and admire.
Creating a comfortable connection should be your top seminar
priority.
_Understanding._ Do the prospects really understand your mes-
sage without distortion or confusion? Did you make it clear and
fun? Did you demystify the topic?
_Respect._ Help prospective clients see that you are a confident,
knowledgeable planner and can help them in their financial lives.
_Emotional uplift._ Effective seminar leaders hit a positive chord
with participants, leading them to feel slightly dissatisfied with
their current financial strategies. You do not want them to feel
guilty or hopeless, but you need to help them realize that there
may be a better way to preserve wealth. If they leave your seminar
still unchallenged intellectually and emotionally, they have no
incentive to call you.
_Desire to change._ You want seminar participants to act as quickly
as possible. You must outline an action plan for your audience.
They will follow it if they become motivated to act. Demonstrate
your expertise and ability to make things happen by showing
them you can help them. For them to be successful, they must
step out of their comfort zone and risk change.
Below is a simple checklist for effective financial planning
seminars:
— Educate, do not sell. Product pushers turn off an audience.
— Interact with the audience. Get your audience involved—the
more, the better.
— Keep it simple; use terms everyone can understand. Keep con-
cepts at the lowest common denominator.
— Use analogies familiar to your audience. Discuss stories the
audience can relate to, especially if it is an industry trade
group, such as doctors.


```
Marketing Your Practice
```

```
— Show up early, stay late. Give the participants a chance to talk
with you before and after the meeting. They may even ask you
to cover a specific topic that is important to that group.
— Use evaluation forms. Learn from your seminar participants. Find
out what you are doing right and wrong. Make changes in your
content and style. Aim for perfection with 100 percent inquiry.
```
```
INQUIRERS
Inquirers are the prospects you have successfully motivated with
your message. These people probably know they should do better
financial planning but are uncomfortable facing the future, mis-
trust “salesmen,” or think they have too little money to plan with. If
someone calls you, for whatever reason, the inquirer has decided to
take action. Be impressed with the significance of this decision and
handle the inquirer with patience and understanding. When the
inquirer calls, whether motivated by direct mail or an article about
you in the local paper, have your team ready to deliver a tight script.
Emphasize the “privilege” of talking to the inquirer, that his or her
concerns are common, and that you or other principals have expe-
rience in helping people in the same situation. The challenge is
to get the inquirer to take the next step and come in to your office
for the preliminary meeting discussed in the PIPRIM client man-
agement system. As a general principle, attempt to make contact
with prospects six times before moving on. These contacts might
consist of a follow-up letter, a seminar invitation, a newsletter, a
phone call, an audiotape, or even a questionnaire.
The task of turning inquirers into clients is handled in depth in
the PIPRIM process described in Chapter 3.
```
```
EXISTING CLIENTS
Existing clients make up your exclusive human-asset base. Your
goal is to retain this valuable asset. Remember that your client
base is a huge investment in time and money and is the easiest
target for price-gouging competitors. There are three goals to
keep in mind with your existing client base: (1) keeping cli-
ents happy, (2) selling them more products and services, and
(3) encouraging referrals.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
The issue of client communication is covered extensively in
Chapter 8. At a minimum you should make an “impression” (direct
contact) with each client at least three times per year. This could
include one or two telephone calls, sending the client an article
about your firm in the local newspaper, and a personal meeting,
if only for coffee. Your task is to make the client feel important
but not used. Make sure your clients have no reason, least of all
price, to switch planners. You must teach your clients that value is
the measure of a financial planner. Always deliver more than your
client expects and you will create an impermeable barrier to com-
petition. Happy clients are open to new financial solutions, so do
not hesitate to bring new ideas to their attention. They expect it.
Finally, let your clients know that you would be grateful for refer-
rals. They expect this, too. You need not offer an overt “payoff” for
referrals, but make it fun for your clients. If you can afford it, put
each referring client’s name into a drawing for a complimentary
(be sure to use that word, not “free”) dinner, gift certificate, or
donation to a favorite charity or civic group. Keep the incentive
upscale and clients will feel delighted, not pressured, to help you.
Like stocks in a portfolio, not all clients are worth keep-
ing. High-maintenance clients who generate little revenue are
unprofitable. You need to separate your clients into categories
A, B, and C. Your A clients are those who believe in you, consis-
tently respond to new ideas, and have income growth potential.
B clients are loyal but have less inclination to try new ideas and
have some income potential. C clients are long shots. They may
have long-term potential, but they are slow to act and generate
little income. Your C client list needs constant churning. Use the
“up or out” method to move clients. If a C client fails to move up
to a B in a year, then move the client out. Cultivate your As and
the top half of your Bs. Keep your cost of servicing low by working
hard to build a small, loyal, and growth-oriented clientele.

REFERRALS
Referrals, like retention of existing clients, is a measure of your
marketing success. The higher the rate of referrals, the more you
should believe in your marketing program and client satisfaction.


```
Marketing Your Practice
```

```
The referral is a special person. He or she is somehow attached
to your client as friend, colleague, or family. This sense of trust is
very delicate. If the referral’s experience with you is less than what
your client in a sense promised, both of you are embarrassed.
Remember, an unhappy customer tells thirteen other people. In
a small community disappointment travels fast.
Nevertheless, the best way to obtain new clients is through
referrals. In fact, when your business begins getting referrals, it
can grow exponentially. When you first start out, the easiest way
to get referrals is to ask for them. Some of your first clients will
know that you are just getting started. If they like your service,
they will be extremely eager to recommend you. If you get reliable
and honest service from a repair shop, restaurant, or department
store, you are probably only too happy to refer friends. The same
is true of financial planners. The work sheet in EXHIBIT 7.2 (see
page 240) is an easy way to track referrals by source.
◆ Niche positioning. This chapter has described how to quantify
your capture area, reach prospects, and convert interested con-
sumers into loyal and productive clients. Although your prospects
may be faceless, your clientele is full of character. Who are the
people you want to call your own? Who is your niche customer?
You simply cannot be all things to all people, so who are you going
to cultivate? You must decide who you are comfortable working
with, who will get your message, and go after that clientele.
A practical approach for the start-up planner is to use the mar-
keting budget to reach and develop one market niche. A niche
population consists of people with similar interests, language,
cultural heritage, occupation, financial profile, or community.
A niche might be high-net-worth families, unmarried high-income
individuals, small business owners, or early retirees. Since a niche
market is highly defined, you will need to become an expert on
the sociology of the group. Understand the values, motivation,
and cultural issues that may affect their accessibility and propen-
sity to plan for financial security.
It is very common to target niches defined by occupations or
demographic groupings. These may include professions (doc-
tors, lawyers, architects, engineers), athletes and entertainers,
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
couples with double incomes and no kids, military personnel,
urbanites, farming communities, technologists, government
employees, educators, and so on. You can also target your mar-
ket by geographic location, as did FPC in the business plan pre-
sented at the end of Chapter 6. A geographic niche always has an
economic, cultural, and educational profile. A local or regional
niche improves accessibility and personalized service but is also
cross-occupational and economically diverse. This may force you
to use multiple marketing tactics and offer a broad product and
service package. Once you select your niche market, define your
practice image and product offering to reflect the needs and
motivations of these individuals.

```
Developing Marketing Tactics:
Understanding the Four Ps
```
product, price, place, and promotion are the four Ps of market-
ing. Balancing these key tactics will help you to reach prospects and
develop clients with a systematic and cost-effective approach.

PRODUCT
Product is what you offer the client: the services you provide and
the products that make the services perform. Before you can
choose the service and product portfolio to offer, you must form a
clear idea of how service and product options satisfy client needs.
Ask yourself the following questions:
◆ What is the purpose of the service or product?
◆ Is this service or product the newest, best possibility?
◆ If you are having trouble increasing your clientele, should you
expand the types of services you provide or products you offer,
such as income tax preparation, mortgage origination, and debt
management? If you limit your services, you run the risk of a client
moving to a competitor to receive one-stop financial shopping.
◆ What are the advantages of your services and products com-
pared to those of your competitors?
◆ Are you offering the right mix of services and products?

PRICE
Price is the monetary return you expect for providing value to
clients. Pricing is a dilemma. There is no de facto “right” price; it
is only what the customer will pay. You must feel comfortable with
what you charge as a representation of the fair market value of
your services. Further, you must consider your target market. Do
you want to be the Waldorf Astoria, charging a high price to a lim-
ited clientele for high service, or Wal-Mart, charging a low price to
many clients for common products? Your pricing must take into
account likely competitor action you identified as threats in your
SWOT analysis. Challenge your thinking about pricing by asking
yourself the following:
◆ What are your pricing objectives? Do you want to attract low-
price clients and hope to build revenue on volume? Remember
that a low-price client requires the same service as a high-price
client. The more clients you have, the more service you must pro-
vide to retain your account base. Conversely, if you decide to be a
high-price competitor, you will have to work harder for each new
client, and the cost of losing high-price clients is steep.
◆ Do you want to preserve pricing flexibility? If so, you need
price ranges to attract the different constituencies you serve. If
you are targeting middle-income families, a fixed fee may be
more appealing. Higher-net-worth clients may be willing to pay a
commission as their asset base appreciates.
```
```
PLACE
Place is where and how you distribute your products. This is
often the area most overlooked by planners. Matching the loca-
tion where you provide service to different clients can affect the
outcome of the transaction and its profitability. For instance,
consider where you engage clients. A person-to-person meeting
might be in a client’s home or office. Indirect engagement may
occur at seminars, through direct mail or cold-calling, or over the
Internet. If you mostly meet in person, pick a location that fits
your target market. If you deal with wealthy individuals, a down-
town location is convenient. A traditional building, such as a Vic-
torian or brownstone, fits a traditional, conservative approach to
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
planning. Modern, all-glass offices suggest new thinking, breaking
the mold, and risk taking. If your target market is commuters, an
office in the suburbs might be appropriate.
Distribution strategies may also involve teaming up with special-
ists in insurance, investments, income tax, retirement planning,
and estate planning. A firm can combine people in each specialty
group, each with its own image.

PROMOTION
Promotion is how you get your message to your target market. It
can involve advertising, public relations, or sales promotion. In
advertising, you pay for media coverage, and you control the mes-
sage. In public relations, you try to convince the media that they
should write or talk about you as part of their editorial function.
You may try to include the following types of media:
◆ Direct mail
◆ Outdoor advertising
◆ Local and regional magazines
◆ Newsletters from trade and membership associations
◆ Newspaper, radio, and cable television advertising

Choosing a media mix is complex. It depends on how acces-
sible your target market is, the frequency of your promotion, and
your budget. Direct mail, or shotgun marketing, is the least expen-
sive medium per impression. At the other end of the marketing
media continuum is a rifle-shot dinner meeting and seminar for
six couples. Your annual marketing plan may include several types
of marketing media aimed to generate awareness at one extreme
and to focus on highly targeted prize clients at the other. Be care-
ful not to diffuse the impact of your marketing program by trying
too many ideas, or worse, none at all.
Developing a public image is very valuable. It could be self-
directed, whereby you develop an image plan, or you could hire a
public relations firm. A PR firm will place you in the news quickly
but temporarily. Your own efforts could be more long lasting.
Consider doing the following:
◆ writing a book


```
Marketing Your Practice
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
◆ writing a column for a community newspaper
◆ teaching a college course
◆ offering commentary and insight to local newspaper personal
finance reporters
◆ establishing a seminar tour
◆ speaking at trade shows or industrywide conferences
```
```
In The Guide to Financial Public Relations, Larry Chambers urges
planners to establish their own public relations program. The
start-up entrepreneur should let his or her best instincts guide a
public image campaign.
EXHIBIT 7.3 (see page 240) is a good tool to test the cohesiveness
of your marketing thinking. Along the left side of the Marketing
Planning Grid are the four Ps. Across the top is a place to write a
brief description (one or two bullet points) of each P. Next, note
the expected result—for example, of a direct mail project. Last,
show the timing—when you want to implement each P. Once you
complete the grid, look for overlap and redundancy of targets.
Make sure your marketing tactics fit your targets. Do not crowd too
much marketing into a short time span.
```
```
Creating Strategic Alliances
strategic alliances with allied professionals have multiple
benefits. First, an alliance network is a barrier to entry. A network
of alliances forces competitors to build their own relationships
or remain narrow. Second, alliances maximize your productivity.
You can continue to focus on your specialty and refer a client to a
trusted colleague in another area of financial planning. Third, an
alliance network is good marketing. Your A clients want one-stop
shopping for broad financial services.
◆Partnering. Partnering means pairing up with one or more
professionals who have a similar business model but a differ-
ent specialty. Your client bases remain separate, but you refer
to each other to expand client revenues. Partnering is not
always balanced. Often one party gains more than the other.
Thus partnering can create healthy competition as well. The
relationship is similar to that of running partners. You pace
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
each other, strengthen each other, but neither of you wants to
be last.
◆ Networking. Everyone talks about networking. The traditional
approach is to ask a friend or a colleague if he or she knows
someone with specific information. The best networking strategy
is the simplest one: make good friends and colleagues, and give
advice when asked. Oddly, the more you depend on a network
for information, leads, and ideas, the further you stray from your
business plan.
◆ Brain trusts. A corporate board of directors provides manage-
ment with direction, depth of experience, and stability. Boards also
hold management accountable for business ethics, performance,
shareholder value, and employee satisfaction. For the same rea-
sons, an entrepreneur needs a brain trust, a board of advisers.
Your brain trust is a strategic alliance. You receive information and
experience from your board, and they receive the intrinsic value of
seeing you succeed. Your board should do the following:
—Help you think outside your business plan toward the future
—Be your eyes and ears to the outside world
—Provide sound guidance on business decisions
— Prod you to evaluate your progress against your business and
marketing plans
— Bring the perspective of other businesses and professions to
your firm
— Be a component of your referral network

The advisory board, partnering, and networking are ways to
expand the competitive wall around your business and your cli-
ents and to deepen your wealth of knowledge and creativity.

The Marketing Budget

the marketing budget amplifies the marketing line item in
your business plan. It also serves the same purpose as the financial
section of your business plan. The marketing budget is partner to
your plan. While the plan explains what you intend to do and with
what results, the budget explains how much it will cost. It should be
easy for the reader or investor to grasp the logic and elements of


```
Marketing Your Practice
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
your marketing plan in numbers. More so than your business plan
financial data, the marketing budget is an ROI exercise. It shows
what it will cost to get your message to a defined group of people
who will buy a defined set of products in a defined period of time.
How many dollars of gross margin (revenue less direct cost of ser-
vices) will you generate with each marketing dollar? The greater
the income, the greater the leverage. Marketing efficiency is mea-
sured in leverage. Reinvest cash from operations in marketing
programs that create high leverage. Abandon those that do not.
EXHIBIT 7.4 (see page 241) presents a sample marketing budget.
```
```
The Action Plan
marketing plans are time- and resource-sensitive. The revenue
stream you committed to in your business plan depends upon a
sequence of events happening on time with the expected results
and within budgeted cost. Thus you need to execute your mar-
keting plan with confidence and thoroughness. Develop a game
plan with very specific tasks, responsibilities, completion dates,
and expected outcomes for each element in your marketing plan.
Create an Action Blueprint as in EXHIBIT 7.5 (see page 242).
Refer to your Action Blueprint weekly. As completion dates
approach, check with the responsible person for an update, then
look ahead to the next two or three tasks. Are you on target with
the results you expect from each task? If so, are the subsequent
marketing tasks still relevant, aggressive, opportunistic? If your
action plan is not progressing as you intended, what adjustments
should you make? Are you getting the overall benefit from your
marketing spending, or are there better, more predictable ways to
accelerate prospects into productive clients?
```
```
Auditing the Results
the practical marketer is constantly evaluating marketing-
plan results in light of setbacks and new opportunities. Do not let
pride of authorship color your willingness to kill a great idea that
simply did not work. At the same time make sure your assessment
is objective. You will want to audit the results of your marketing
plan periodically using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Qualitative information helps you fine-tune your message and
marketing tactics, while quantitative information measures how
effectively you are reaching your marketing goals.
◆ Quantitative methods. You made assumptions in your market-
ing plan about the size, accessibility, and value of your target
market. Based upon these assumptions you set revenue goals for
the first few years of your firm. Rather than waiting until the end
of year one to confirm your assumptions and total your revenue,
try to predict the impact of marketing as you move through your
marketing plan. Prepare a simple, five-question survey like the
one in EXHIBIT 7.6 (see page 243) and mail it to one hundred
people on your prospect list.
Notice the design of the questionnaire. It is very informal,
friendly, personal, and easy to complete. The ratio of “yes” to
“no” answers to question one will give a sense of your penetra-
tion. Any awareness over 5 percent from your prospect list is
good. Question two measures which marketing tactic created
awareness. This information helps you decide where to put addi-
tional marketing money. Question three tells whether your
intended message was understood and remembered. Question
four measures the respondents’ readiness for planning help. If
the respondents are familiar with FPC and understand how the
company could help with money issues, how many of them are
thinking about getting help? Question five queries the reasons
why respondents have not acted to get help. These answers will
help you to communicate more effectively with prospects in
future marketing efforts. Finally, the questionnaire asks if the
respondent would like to talk to FPC. The questionnaire itself
is a marketing tool. Prepare statistics on each of the questions.
The higher the frequency of response, the greater the predictive
power of the information for future planning.
◆ Qualitative methods. Quantitative methods work best when
enough time has passed after a marketing campaign to stimu-
late a significant group of prospects (or clients) to act. You are
interested in the predictive power of the information. The limita-
tion of quantitative methods is the survey itself. You get no more
information than what you have asked for. There is no chance


```
Marketing Your Practice
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
to explore questions in greater depth or study new areas. This is
where qualitative methods are useful. Qualitative market research
does not predict or add volume, it adds tone or richness to your
knowledge base.
Peer review is one way to get feedback on your marketing pro-
gram. Invite a potential partner to a seminar or workshop and
ask him or her to evaluate your message, style, visual aids, and
follow-through. Peer reviews can be mutually beneficial. Critique
each other.
Never be afraid to talk to strangers. In the self-help or personal
finance section of your local bookstore, look for the browsers. Do
they seem upscale? What are they reading? What are they buying?
Without appearing bold, ask a browser to recommend any of the
books on the shelf. This is your entree to finding out what these
people are thinking. You may use the same approach at your
public library, a book fair, a continuing-education open house,
or your local college.
Client-appreciation dinners demonstrate your appreciation
but also let you find out what clients are thinking. Many planners
have quarterly events, inviting three to six clients to each. Invite a
partner or specialist to share the cost and the information. At the
dinner, test some of your marketing and new-product ideas. Pass
a draft brochure around the table and ask for feedback. Ask your
clients why their friends do not use professional financial help.
This information may add to what you learn from the prospect
questionnaire suggested above.
Most clients will help you improve your practice. They too ben-
efit from new ideas. Consider a questionnaire for clients. Unlike
the prospect survey, you are not interested in how many clients
think a certain way; you are interested in their ideas and their
image of your practice. EXHIBIT 7.7 (see page 244) is a sample client
questionnaire.
Financial planning is an evolving business. Innovation in
products, services, communication tools, and organization is
occurring every day in your market. You need to stay ahead of
the competition by understanding consumer needs before they
do. No one told Apple Computer that a purple, see-through, all-
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
in-one, plug-and-play desktop computer was what they wanted.
Apple created the need _and_ the market. You must do the same
with your business. Continually ask yourself questions like the
following:
◆ Why am I in business?
◆ What do I want from my business?
◆ Whom do I serve?
◆ What is my service? Is it valuable? How valuable?
◆ Are my business plan and marketing plan working? What can I
do to make both work better?

The marketing plan is the blueprint that an enterprise
pursues to accomplish its growth and image objectives. It is
that path that leads and transforms a business from start-up to
financial and personal success. The pathway includes market
analysis, market targets and tactics, the four Ps, alliances, bud-
get, action, and evaluation. Remember to plan the details very
well. You need to understand more than the marketplace and
where you fit in. You need to understand how to turn opportu-
nity into reality.

communication is the intentional exchange of infor-

mation among multiple parties. This working definition

makes it easy to imagine how communication goes awry,

missing its original intention. First, the number of par-

ties affects communication. In financial planning it is

more difficult to work with a husband and wife, father

and son, or business partners than to plan with one per-

son. Second, intention is very difficult to manage. You

THE ART

COMMUNICATION

##### CHAPTER 8


```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
will encounter clients who are not ready to hear you. Your inten-
tion is supportive and positive, but it may be perceived as cold
and blunt. Intention, then, is subject to interpretation, a force
you cannot easily control. Exchange implies something hap-
pening in two directions. You, the planner, are exchanging
information for money. Your client is exchanging information
for financial security. Unless there is an overt balance in the
exchange, one party may feel undercompensated. This issue, left
unresolved, will ruin a relationship.
It is interesting to consider that on the surface the financial
planner is simply providing a client with “numbers.” However,
in a far deeper sense the numbers are draped with meaning.
Your financial analysis and planning proposal are very much like
a report card on the life of your client. You may think that you
are delivering good news: with proper planning your client can
secure his or her future well-being. It is just as likely that you are
the bearer of bad news: your client has failed to manage his or her
financial security, and now the price must be paid—save or suf-
fer. Money is mixed with emotion, and you need to be prepared
to handle both.
Thus, communication is central to the professional relation-
ship. It gives rise to a cycle of action and reaction. When one per-
son communicates a message, the other will react. As a financial
planner, you need to respect and understand the reaction you
elicit from a client. The greater the sincerity of your understand-
ing, the greater the trust and loyalty you will enjoy. Communica-
tion also involves motivating and influencing your clients to take
action. Good financial planners know how to communicate, both
by talking and by listening effectively to their clients.
Communication plays a significant part in the financial plan-
ning process described in Chapter 3. Communication begins
even before a lead or prospect becomes a client. It begins by your
understanding yourself. It continues through the first contact
and preliminary interview, when both parties are deciding if they
can work together. Communication continues through interview-
ing the client to determine goals and objectives, and reaches a
maximum complexity when you give the client the “report card”


```
The Art of Client Communication
```

```
and advise on alternative ways to achieve the client’s objectives.
At every point in the financial planning process, unburdened
communication yields better information and therefore better
planning. How you can communicate effectively in your new pro-
fessional role is the subject of this chapter.
```
```
The Financial Planner Plays Many Roles
highly successful financial planners are insightful. They
know more than just the technical side of their business. They
are skilled in helping the client handle the discomfort of money,
past behavior, preparation for the unknown, and responsibility.
Most financial planners may not think about the complexity of
their relationship with a client. The issue of mutual dependency
and the emotional energy involved are often not played out in
communication. This can or cannot be a problem, but it should
provoke awareness. Over time the adviser/client relationship will
change. It may begin competitively. The client wants the planner
to be impressed with his previous financial success: “I don’t need
you, but maybe you can help in some way.” The planner wants
the client to be impressed with his or her credentials, client base,
or professional success: “This client doesn’t realize how little he
knows about investment strategy, but I’ll teach him.” This is not
to suggest that client and adviser sit across from each other filled
with devious thoughts. It does suggest that there are unnoticed
issues going on in the background that both parties must try to
tune in to and resolve. You are not a psychologist or therapist, but
you are dealing with money and emotion, dangerous territory.
Consider that a major reason for marital arguments and divorce
is conflict over money.
What are the overt and hidden roles the financial planner will
occupy in the course of a professional relationship? How do you
know when these roles are likely to occur, and how do you man-
age them in a successful consultancy?
First, do you understand yourself? Why do you want to be a finan-
cial planner? If the answer revolves around working at home, keep-
ing your own hours, being independent, making a lot of money, and
dabbling in the stock market, think harder. These are not all the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
reasons. Is something else going on? What are your emotional attach-
ments to the life of a financial planner? The need to help, the need
to control, the need to parent, the need to be important? You must
ask yourself honestly if any of these issues are involved. Your spouse
or a close friend may help you see how your personality aligns with
the roles of financial planner. Accept and manage whatever moti-
vation you uncover. Awareness is the best way to keep background
issues and energy in a positive direction for you and the client.
Why are leads, prospects, or clients seeking your help? Help
them think through their dreams and worries, and you will help
them understand what they will need to reach their expectations
and prepare for financial independence. A good planner consid-
ers a client’s entire situation by assessing the client’s responses to
the following questions:
◆ What is important to the client? Financial security, or feeling
competent, or both?
◆ Why are these things important? To himself, to others, or both?
◆ How does the client feel about himself? Does he think of him-
self as a financial success or a failure?
◆ How does the client feel about money? Is money good or sim-
ply a necessity?
◆ Is the client willing and able to do what it takes to become
financially secure? If not, why not?
◆ What issues could work against the client’s achieving his or her
goals? Do I have any control over these issues, or are they personal
to the client? If I am unable to control these issues, can I be suc-
cessful in helping the client? An organizational psychologist, Harry
Levinson, uses a medical model to describe his work. Levinson says
that sometimes a business consultant “opens up” an organization
and finds that nothing can be done to solve its problems. If you
“open up” a client and find that the client is not ready to be helped
or cannot be helped, you are obligated to say so.

Most often, however, these questions help you get a picture of
clients’ intangible needs, which are as or more important than their
tangible requirements. The questions help you learn very specifi-
cally what the clients’ needs and goals are. The answers will point


```
The Art of Client Communication
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
you toward some of the key issues in assembling an understanding
of the client and in preparing a comprehensive financial plan.
The first question asks a client to describe what is important and
allows the client to tell you about issues of concern. Do monetary
or material things hold greater importance than intangible items?
If so, then the focus should be on material accumulation to achieve
wealth. It means helping the client organize goals to accumulate
very specific tangibles, such as a second house, a fancier car, the
latest technological equipment, a boat, and so on. If the client is
interested in leaving a legacy to a child, school, or religious institu-
tion, ways to maximize these goals can be designed. Establishing a
charitable lead or remainder trust can help pursue these dreams.
These philanthropic goals may compete with or be complementary
to the goals stated earlier. Indeed, there can be some combination
of goals, which is fine. The point is to uncover the various motiva-
tions that precede strategies toward financial independence.
The second question asks “Why?” Clearly, there must be an
underlying reason to explain why the client has these dreams.
Finding out why delves deeper into a particular situation and
ensures proper planning on your part. If clients come to you and
say that their religious institution is struggling and they want to
do good for the institution, you will feel a sense of joy in help-
ing them achieve these objectives, possibly helping the clients
establish a legacy in their own right. A client may feel a need for
acquiring material objects because of childhood poverty or paren-
tal denial, and he and his spouse have made a pact that if they are
fortunate enough to become wealthy, they will provide for their
children. Again, the only way to find out is to ask.
The third question asks clients to evaluate their self-esteem.
Their response reflects how they feel about themselves and oth-
ers, such as friends and family. You will be able to tell whether
they want to help themselves or their loved ones. It will also help
them put in perspective just what are the critical factors in their
life, which leads to the next question.
The fourth question asks clients why money is important to them.
Ask your clients to relay their earliest experiences with money and
the impact it has made on their lives. Ask these questions of each
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
spouse in the presence of the other. Many times the responses will
shed new light on an old subject about which the other spouse may
have no clue. Lessons will be learned, and even more important,
objectives will become clearer and the focus more obvious.
The fifth question asks whether the client is ready to do what it
takes to create personal wealth; the answer is not quite as obvious
as it would appear. There are many people who insist on living life
to the fullest, doing things they can afford to do, such as traveling;
attending the theater, concerts, and sporting events; dining out
frequently; buying lavish items; and so on. Their objective can be
to “zero out” at death, or, in other words, not to leave any money
to their children, spending it all while they are healthy. These
people are less intent on building assets on a balance sheet than
on creating expenses on an income statement. There is no right
or wrong response to this question. Clearly, though, you need to
know which way the client is focused.
The last question asks why the clients believe that their long-
term goals can be achieved. This reverts back to the basics, which
are what is important to you, and how do you plan to achieve it? It
involves ranking priorities from most important to least important
and setting specific objectives for each (as described in Chapter
3). Do the clients have the fortitude to achieve goals over a long
period of time? The objectives carry a time element, a monetary
amount, and a person responsible for each accomplishment.
As a planner, you must learn to ask appropriate questions (as
discussed in connection with the PIPRIM process in Chapter 3)
and to listen closely to the answers as you record them. You will
also need to communicate with clients in a way that ensures they
expect services you can provide and they stay comfortable with
the process. Once you begin asking these questions of enough
clients, you will begin to feel a sense of direction as to what can or
can’t help a client’s unique financial situation.

Information Processing

as a financial consultant, you must be aware of the different
ways your clients process information. Experiences may be under-
stood through one of the following lenses:

```
◆ Visual. Clients who communicate visually may do well by watch-
ing others, seeing a film, or studying diagrams.
◆ Auditory. This type of learning focuses on acquiring informa-
tion through talking and listening.
◆ Kinesthetic. This type of learning focuses on active participa-
tion, trial and error, or physical activity.
```
```
Try to use some of each style in information collection from
your client. Use graphs, for example, to explain difficult concepts
as you talk about the issue. It is much easier to help clients under-
stand issues in their preferred learning style than it is to use logi-
cal arguments to persuade them to change. Helping your clients
to achieve their goals or to change their behavior is accomplished
more easily if you help them process appropriate information in
the mode best suited to their learning style.

How Do People Communicate?
communication is often thought of as verbal or nonverbal
cues designed to provoke a response. In fact, everything we
do communicates something. Even doing nothing is a state-
ment of sorts. Effective communication takes place when the
receiver interprets the sender’s message in precisely the same
fashion that it was sent. Difficulties arise when the receiver
misunderstands the sender’s message. Since an individual’s
intentions are private and rarely clearly stated, the receiver has
the difficult job of decoding the message without knowing the
sender’s intentions.
You are the receiver trying to get the client to open up. Ask
open-ended questions and pay attention to tone of voice, volume,
and speed of expressions, as well as the words of the reply.
There are five “knowns” you need to remember to effectively
communicate with your client.
1 Clients use words, space, tonality, rate, and volume of speech
and other nonverbal actions to communicate facts and feelings.
2 Men and women, husbands and wives, young and older people
communicate differently.
3 Initial impressions affect interaction for a long time.
```

```

```
4 Communication is constantly being influenced by multiple
factors.
5 Personal life experiences leave a hidden mark on everyone.

Here is how to apply these five “knowns” to client commu-
nication.
◆ Clients use words, space, tonality, rate, and volume of speech
and other nonverbal actions to communicate. Words themselves
can mean different things to different clients. To one person, risk
may mean going to Las Vegas with $100, while to another it may
mean investing in futures.
Tonality, rate, and volume of speech are communication tools.
Tone and pitch may indicate the speaker’s feelings. For example,
angry people often talk loudly, while sad people tend to talk in a
flat tone. Furthermore, people sometimes mix signals, with the
words communicating one thing and the tone and pitch trans-
mitting just the opposite. Both messages may be important. Keep
asking questions until the meaning becomes clearer.
The nonverbal channel is also used to communicate. A stare
from a parent to a child often signifies that the child did some-
thing to merit disapproval. Eye contact, facial expressions, and
gestures are other important nonverbal behaviors. Some clients
look you square in the eye to ensure you are telling them the truth,
or perhaps they sense anger or hostility. Clients who avoid looking
at you may be fearful or uninterested. Facial expressions—smiles,
frowns, bit lips, or nervous tics—can also demonstrate interest or
a lack thereof. Try to notice these habits when the topic changes.
See which topics are more sensitive. Gestures with the arm or
hand can accentuate other statements. Tightly clasped hands can
emphasize fear or anxiety, whereas free-flowing arm or hand ges-
tures may display comfort. Frequent crossing or uncrossing of legs
may indicate boredom or anxiety.
Look at overall body position. Clients who sit up straight are
usually relaxed. If they lean slightly forward, it is usually a sign of
interest and involvement in the planning session. If they slouch
or seem to draw away from the planner, it may show that they
have little interest in what the planner is saying. Good posture


```

```

```
may signify high self-esteem or self-assurance, and poor posture
the opposite. Body movements also send a signal. The client who
frequently changes body position may be indicating physical or
emotional discomfort or a lack of interest. People who bite their
nails, pull at their hair, or fidget may be very nervous. People who
greet friends and family with a kiss, hug, or warm handshake may
be very open and warm.
Space between two people also conveys information. Ameri-
cans normally stay at least thirty-six inches away from people
they do not know. This is considered public space. The figure is
thirty inches for those we know better, and twenty-four inches for
those we know and trust. When two people are very comfortable
together, they may stand closer than twenty-four inches apart.
This is intimate space. Effective communicators are aware of how
their use of space affects others, and consequently, they use it to
make others feel comfortable.
◆ Men and women communicate differently. According to a study
by Judy Cornelia Pearson, women tend to use formal words and
phrases, whereas men often use more informal ones. Females
appear to prefer the specificity that language can provide, where-
as males appear to focus on the underlying issues. When working
with a couple, you should provide language that allows everyone
to understand the same message. Address both members of a
couple together. If you talk with one spouse when the other is
unavailable and one partner later communicates the message to
the other, it may be interpreted differently than you intended.
◆ Initial impressions affect communication long term. In their
book, Contact: The First Four Minutes , authors Leonard Zunin and
Natalie Zunin conclude that the first four minutes of an interper-
sonal interaction are the key to establishing social relationships,
family harmony, and business success. You can only make one first
impression, so make it count. A firm handshake, a smile, or other-
wise conveying warmth and sincerity can make a good impression.
◆ Communication is constantly being influenced by multiple fac-
tors. Communication is affected by motivation, credibility, orga-
nization, and style. It is crucial to help clients see the big picture
and motivate them to take action. If the clients are not moving
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
in this direction, you should be able to read the signs and adjust
your presentation accordingly.
People act more readily if information comes from a credible
source. Be extremely professional, sincere, up front, and direct
about what needs to be done to improve the clients’ financial
situation. If they trust you, you can accomplish more. Organiza-
tion is also critical. Information given at the beginning or end of
a presentation is remembered more clearly than material in the
middle. Make your most important points first or last.
Style describes your overall approach to a client. It can take
several forms:
— Be an authoritative figure; when you speak, people listen.
— Emphasize the client’s understanding of information to create
self-confidence.
— Emphasize a low-key, low-pressure approach. You place the
responsibility for action directly in the hands of the client.

In using any of these styles, remember that the planner con-
trols the process. The client is responsible for content. We can
only work with the information they give us.
◆ Life experience leaves a hidden mark on everyone. Experi-
ence has an effect on everyone. Perhaps clients went to a different
financial planner before you. They began with $500,000 to invest,
but after three years of working with that other planner, the nest egg
dropped to $300,000. These clients will have great difficulty trusting
another adviser as much as they trusted the first one. That is because
their expectations were never managed. That makes your job more
difficult. The key to building trust into the relationship is to be open,
honest, and sincere. Mean what you say, and say what you mean. Tell
them in advance whether you believe their objectives are realistic.
Be frank. Tell them when it looks unlikely for them to achieve goals.
Give difficult advice, such as their need to reduce current spending
habits, when necessary. When you educate the client in all of these
areas, it raises the trust and confidence level significantly. With cli-
ents on a higher plateau, questions become more focused on the
key issues surrounding their surge into financial independence. This
higher-level conversation between financial planners and clients

```
enables their expectations to become managed. It also reduces the
likelihood that they will sue you.
```
```
Structuring Communication
structuring a meeting determines the format and the subject
matter of future communication. Make the purpose of the session
clear to the client at the outset. Explain the process and forms
involved, the amount of time required, and the confidential
nature of the relationship, and give some prediction of what out-
comes the client might reasonably expect. This structuring need
not be long and cumbersome. Rather, it should be clear, concise,
and straightforward. You might say, “Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, our
relationship will consist of four in-person meetings plus unlimited
phone support. Each in-person meeting will focus on a different
part of the plan. In order to guide you throughout our relation-
ship, any time something comes up or you need further clarifica-
tion or you just want some quick advice, always call. We do not
charge for phone time. Does this arrangement work for you?”
Attend to your clients’ feelings immediately—do not put them
off. Nip discrepancies or uncomfortable feelings in the bud, or
they may come back to haunt you. For example, your client might
say, “Mr. Smith, you never informed me that you were not going
to notify me when certain asset classes went down by more than 15
percent.” Or, “I don’t believe you’re listening to what I’m saying.”
In responding to this, you need to say to the client, “Are there
other issues I have not addressed?” If the client seems agitated,
you may explore the situation by asking, “Are other things hap-
pening that cause you concern, such as an impending divorce,
forced layoff at work, or health condition?”
Structure allows you to help your clients manage their expec-
tations. Clients may not even understand the nature of the
planner-client relationship. Clients can misinterpret what they
are expected to receive. For example, maybe you believed your
relationship with a particular client was to involve only an up-
front plan, whereas the client thought there would be numerous
one-on-one sessions on an ongoing basis. Well, who is right? If you
did not clearly state your understanding of the terms before, how
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
do you determine when the relationship starts and when it ends?
One way to alleviate this is through the use of an engagement let-
ter (as explained in Chapter 3). You will need a few more rules to
be a good communicator.
◆ Be yourself. Your clients must accept you for who you are and
what you represent. Lay all your cards on the table at the first
meeting. Be genuine—let the client see you as a real person. You
do not have to wear a different hat for each client. Be yourself at
all times.
◆ Tune in to your client. Listen to your clients. When the client
says, “You’re right on track,” or “That’s exactly right,” you can
feel confident that you have a good understanding. Learning to
understand is not always easy. Your feelings and experiences must
take a backseat to what is truly important to the clients. See the
issues through their eyes, not yours. Listen carefully to both the
subtle and the obvious content of what your clients say. Still, avoid
getting too caught up in the clients’ perspective. If you relate too
closely to their situation, you cannot provide objective advice.
The most effective communication occurs when a message’s
receiver gives understanding responses, also called paraphrases.
For example, if the client expresses doubt, such as “I don’t
believe that we can retire at age sixty-five. We may have to push
it back,” your response may be, “So you’re not sure that you have
the resources to retire at age sixty-five. My job is to see how we
can either give you sufficient resources or make changes in your
lifestyle that will enable you to achieve your dream of financial
independence.”
People rarely retract what they have stated to you. If they com-
municate financial planning facts to you, they believe it. To gain
clarification, state in your own words the ideas they expressed to
you. You will find that they will usually agree with your rephrasing.
In the end, the most important thing you can do for your
clients is to make them feel important. Have them decide what
works best, and concur with their decision.
◆ Be positive. Although there is no need to paint a rosy picture
if it is not warranted, do put enthusiasm into the client’s situation.
Try to show the glass as half full rather than half empty. Avoid rec-


```

```

```
ommending ideas you do not believe in. Your sincerity and your
positiveness must come from the heart. Remember, planners run
into trouble when they do not adequately manage their clients’
expectations. That means that whatever standards you set in the
beginning for your clients and yourself should be understood, so
that everyone knows what needs to be done to meet expectations.
◆ Establish rapport. To keep a friendly, open atmosphere
between you and your clients, maintain a caring, interested con-
cern. Proceed at an unhurried pace, and project an accepting,
nonjudgmental attitude. Practice attentive, active listening. Put
the client first in any discussions.
◆ Let the client talk. Ask open-ended questions. This lets clients
give you complete and comprehensive information. Closed-
ended questions, by contrast, typically generate only a one-word
response. Both types of questioning are necessary to gain critical
insight into a client’s situation.
Open-ended questions might include the following:
— Tell me your first experiences involving money.
— What are you trying to accomplish by creating a financial
plan?
— Why have you waited to begin saving for retirement?
— What are your thoughts about designing an asset allocation
strategy?
— What do you hope your retirement will be like?
```
```
Closed-ended questions might include the following:
—Have you given any thought to retirement?
— Are you interested in developing a financial plan now?
— Are you worried about starting a retirement savings program
now?
— Are you in favor of an asset allocation strategy?
— At what age do you plan to retire?
```
```
Of course, these questions should not feel like an interroga-
tion, so try to mix questions and statements together. Remember,
too much questioning may dilute its purpose, which is to find out
as much as possible about your client’s situation.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Be sure to stay away from leading questions. These questions
usually begin with “Don’t you think” or “Do you feel that.” Leading
questions can steer clients toward statements that may not reflect
what they really think. Questions should help clients think through
the situation and come up with their appropriate course of action.

TYPES OF CLIENT OBJECTIONS
Financial planners must learn to deal with client objections.
Clients do not typically object to the services you provide or the
products you recommend. They do object to planners they do not
trust or expectations that are not met. Objectors come in the fol-
lowing types: a client whose needs are not understood; one whose
plan has a risk/reward ratio that is too close; a client who fears
making quick decisions; one who is not convinced your solution
will work; and a client who was told to raise an objection.
◆ Not understanding your client’s needs. Your clients come to
you because of outstanding concerns that can hinder the pros-
pect of their future financial independence. They want to address
these concerns in a rational and systematic format. If you do not
listen to what they say, your clients will become frustrated and
seek advice elsewhere.
◆ A risk/reward ratio that is too close. Clients will be unwilling
to implement new ideas and strategies if the risk for undertak-
ing these developments is not significantly less than its reward.
There must be some incentive for clients to act—to see the light
at the end of the tunnel. Discuss with your clients the options
available to help them achieve their goals while minimizing risk
at the same time.
◆ A client who fears making quick decisions. Never put your
clients on the spot to act immediately. That is a turnoff for the
clients and a hindrance to your ability to get things done in the
future. Present your plan to the clients in draft form and give
them time to read it and digest its meaning. Then meet with them
to address what the next step should be and what action would be
appropriate to take.
◆ A client who is not convinced your solution will work. Your
client should know that you do not have all the answers. You


```
The Art of Client Communication
```

```
should not be expected to name the next great growth stocks
or where interest rates are headed. That is not where your value
is. It is in the education process you give clients so that they can
dissect important information and learn how your solutions can
help them achieve their ultimate goals. From your training, you
are knowledgeable enough to guide them to the next level. They
must be convinced of this fact and know that you are on their
side. Your job is to help clients stay the course—and that can only
be accomplished through a complete buy-in to the education
process. It is only then, when the clients buy in to your approach
to the financial planning process, that they will be willing to hear
you out and adopt your recommendations.
◆ A client who was told to raise an objection. Many times your
clients will raise objections or challenge you on issues whether
they are valid or not. These clients were told, probably by others,
to never accept recommendations from planners at face value
and to be on guard against possible unnecessary sales.
```
```
OVERCOMING OBJECTIONS
Just because the client is not hearing you or responding to you
does not mean all is lost. You can overcome objections by imple-
menting these techniques:
◆ Hear your client out. Let your clients voice their concerns or
frustration without interruption. Let them get off their chests
issues that may cripple the planning process before it starts. What
you can do to overcome these actions is to listen to these state-
ments carefully and then educate them in these areas. Explain to
them what is required and sincerely explain the pros and cons of
both sides. There is never one way to do things, and perhaps their
concerns are valid. But the only way to dig through uneducated
objections or genuine concerns is to provide an understanding
that brings out the other side of their objections.
◆ Isolate the problem. Try to fix one thing at a time rather than
everything at once. It is nearly impossible to do everything for the
client all at once. You must isolate the concerns of the client and
be selective in your approach by addressing those issues of critical
importance first, based on the client’s life. Give them a way to save
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
for their specific objectives in a piecemeal fashion so that some
achievement is attainable.
◆ Question the objection. Never accept or immediately answer
an objection after it is given. Ask the client to explain the objec-
tion in detail. This will allow you to determine what the underly-
ing cause of the objection is and address solutions to overcome
those stumbling blocks. You should never criticize the client
or his or her objection. Rather, you should re-examine it in a
positive light and help the client to see the benefit of turning it
around.
◆ Confirm criteria. This helps reestablish commitment. Consis-
tently during the process, reiterate to clients what their objectives
are. Show them how they tie in to what they want to accomplish
financially. Make sure they are clear about their objectives.
◆ Answer creatively. Restate what clients tell you in their words
to demonstrate that you understand exactly what they are saying.
Then rephrase their comments while still trying to emphasize the
main points. Give the client something new. Avoid run-of-the-mill
answers that clients can find using generic software programs or
books. Restate your clients’ concerns the first time you hear them
and then rephrase their responses while still trying to emphasize
the main points. Every time you provide solutions to address your
clients’ recommendations, repeat your main points in different
ways. This approach helps educate the client and tells them many
different ways how you will help them achieve their financial
objectives.
◆ Confirm your response. Make sure that you have answered
the objection to the client’s satisfaction. Once you identify the
client’s concern and address that concern by educating the client,
reconfirm your approach to ensure that your client understands
how it ties together.
◆ Understanding the client’s value system. Your clients have
moral values that they live by. These moral values should tie
in to the objectives they want to achieve. You should recognize
their most important concerns and address your recommenda-
tions to each one.


```

```

```
Every client has a definite idea of what is acceptable and what
is not. If your recommendations are to be successful, they must
mesh with the client’s value system. If socially conscious invest-
ing is important to a client, you probably should not recommend
Philip Morris stock. Your job is to determine what it takes to make
clients act within their value system in a way that will help them
reach their goals. Develop a framework they are comfortable with.
You must listen carefully to your clients as they sift through the
various value choices, so that when they do finally make up their
minds, they will do so with a high level of comfort. Clients must
buy into the process and ultimately make choices that are consis-
tent with their values.
```
```
Presenting Financial Plans
and Reports to Your Clients
```
```
the way you present a financial plan has a direct impact on what
happens next. A bad presentation can turn clients away from your
plan or even toward finding another planner to help implement
your recommendations. A good presentation helps clients imple-
ment your findings. If your clients are a couple, explain the plan to
both of them, or you risk the possibility of one partner explaining
the plan to the other very differently than you intended.
Point out clients’ positive actions. Show them the good things
they have done so far and how they can add your recommenda-
tions. Show them that by positioning their existing assets in a
certain manner, they can achieve more return with no additional
risk (if true). Or show them how they can reconfigure their exist-
ing expenses to move them toward their goals a little faster. Show
them where they are (point A) and where they want to be (point
B). Then show them the road map that will get them from point A
to point B. Communicate recommendations in a low-key, positive,
definitive manner. Being too sales-oriented can work against you.
You are not selling clients a product. Rather, you are devising a
strategy to help clients reach the goal of financial independence.
Your plan should be simple—visually graphic and as clear
as possible. There are many different software programs in the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
marketplace to help you prepare a dynamic presentation. What
should the financial plan show?
◆ Multiple colors, not pastels
◆ Graphic design
◆ Simplicity
◆ Specifics
◆ Action items/recommendations

EXHIBIT 8.1 (see pages 263–266) illustrates pages extracted
from the financial plan of Jeff and Sally Williams. The balance
sheet measures assets owned, liabilities owed, and the ensuing
net worth of the clients at a particular date. The cash flow state-
ment summarizes the clients’ inflow and outflow during the past
year. Showing graphic charts like these to clients enables them to
understand in clear and concise terms where they stand now and
will help get them where they need to be in the future through
the creation of a financial plan.
Look at the chart on page 264 entitled “Current Cash Flow
Management.” In the original, all the cash flow captions are in
different colors. As explained before, many people are visual
learners. They need to see ideas in front of them. The graph
explains what they have currently. You can also include a graph
on what they will eventually need to achieve in order to accom-
plish their objectives.
When explaining concepts to clients, always talk conversation-
ally with them. Never make statements that clients cannot follow.
Ask clients whether they understand. Ask, “Does this make sense?”
“Do you have an idea of where you stand?” or “Are you comfort-
able with this?” Clients need to wholeheartedly support the plan
and know what to do when they leave the office.
The Client Communication Checklist in EXHIBIT 8.2 (see page
267) summarizes many of the points expressed in this chapter. To
ensure that you have established effective communication with new
clients or existing ones, complete the checklist for each client.

This is your personal financial plan, a profile and analysis of your cur-
rent financial resources and your objectives. It is designed to be a
starting point to help you develop plans and strategies to reach your
financial goals. It covers many aspects of your financial situation.
```
```
YOUR CURRENT RESOURCES
◆ Net worth. You currently have a net worth of $1,274,992. You
can increase your net worth by increasing savings or by reducing the
amount of your debt.
◆ Cash flow. For 2005, we estimate that you will have $65,000 to
fund your financial objectives. To fully fund these objectives will require
60 percent of your available cash in 2005, or $39,000. This will leave
you with $26,000 cash to fund unforeseen spending. You may decide
to increase this reserve by decreasing your variable expenses.
◆ Income tax. You are currently paying 39 percent of your income
to various government entities in the form of taxes. This percentage
does not include personal property, sales, or sundry taxes. See the
Income Tax Planning section for ideas on steps you could take to
reduce your tax burden.

the principles explained throughout this book are

meant to help new advisers get started in developing,

nurturing, and monitoring a financial planning practice.

They can also help planners transform their practice’s

commission-based approach to a more process-

oriented fee-based approach. Top-notch planners cur-

rently employing these principles in their practices

have been asked to share some of their experiences.

RUNNING AN

INTEGRATED

PRACTICE

##### CHAPTER 9


```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Their responses have been incorporated into the following case
studies. These case studies illustrate common situations that may
be encountered while building a practice and show new advisers
how to plan for their clients sensibly, efficiently, and effectively.

Case 1: Mary Leonard—Recently Widowed

mary leonard is a seventy-two-year-old widow whose husband
managed the family’s financial affairs for fifty years. Her husband
died one month ago. Another client referred Mary to Planner A.
How does Planner A begin? As was outlined in Chapter 3, the
best place to start is with the PIPRIM system.

```
Preliminary meeting with a client
Integrated goal setting and data gathering
Putting it all together
Recommending solutions
Implementing the plan
Monitoring the plan
```
The PIPRIM system can be used for any case that presents itself.
It is a process that will enable Planner A to make sure his clients
are being handled properly. It also provides the framework for an
orderly and organized approach to dealing with clients.

PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH A CLIENT
Planner A greets Mary in the waiting room, where his assistant has
already offered her a beverage and made her feel welcome. He
introduces himself and invites Mary into the conference room,
where he begins the conversation by asking how she is doing.
Mary begins by discussing her husband, what they did together,
how he took care of all the financial issues, and how different it
will be without him. Planner A informs her that he is here to help
her get through this most difficult time and will work with her to
create a financial plan that she is comfortable with.
Working with a client whose partner has died can be an emo-
tion-filled and complex process. Mary must feel secure if she
is to continue to open up to Planner A. With the appropriate


```
Running an Integrated Practice
```

```
amount of hand-holding, she will eventually trust him to invest
and manage her money. Many planners are either not willing or
not capable of providing such a time-consuming level of service.
Therefore Planner A must be sure that it makes sense to add this
type of client to his practice. The amount of client service this
type of client requires may continue to increase substantially. As
part of the practice’s business plan, Planner A must determine
whether he can make the sacrifices necessary to provide this type
of client with the emotional support she will need.
When dealing with a client such as Mary, Planner A isn’t look-
ing for short-term solutions through inappropriate investments.
Even though she is older, she is treated as a long-term client.
That means Planner A won’t suggest anything fancy or unsuit-
able. For example, he won’t automatically put her in an annuity
or another fixed type of investment program without first doing
the appropriate analysis. She may be concerned about running
out of money sooner rather than later, in which case an annuity
could be a good choice for her. Unfortunately, approximately 93
percent of all annuities never pay out in full, an indication that
they are sold for the wrong reasons.
Planner A summarizes the conclusions reached by and agreed
upon by both parties in a formal engagement letter to ensure that
the type of services he will provide meets Mary’s expectations.
A client may even want to meet with Planner A several times more
before signing. She may be concerned about making a mistake or
“signing her life away.” Meeting with a client as often as necessary
helps assuage any fears and solidify the relationship.
```
```
INTEGRATED GOAL SETTING AND DATA GATHERING
Now that Planner A is beyond the initial meeting, it is time to
set Mary’s goals. He begins by asking questions centered on her
overall objectives. Does she plan to change anything about her
current living situation? Has she considered moving to be closer
to her children? Are her children committed to taking care of
her should she become ill? Or would she downsize her house or
move to an adult or assisted-living community? Does she have
long-term-care insurance?
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
After Planner A identifies Mary’s needs, funds must be allo-
cated to her objectives. If funds aren’t available to purchase
long-term-care insurance, for example, alternative avenues must
be pursued. Perhaps a relative is able to help fund Mary’s long-
term-care needs.
Planner A also reviews all of her estate planning documents,
such as wills and trusts. Many times such documents were pre-
pared years ago and are completely outdated, with deceased or
divorced beneficiaries or incorrect addresses or other personal
information, or they were drafted in a state other than where the
client is now living (such as a community-property or common-
law state).
Remember, goals and objectives are different; objectives quan-
tify goals by setting definitive dollar amounts and time frames for
each. Planner A needs to ensure that his client is as specific as
possible in her descriptions and as direct as possible concerning
her future plans. He makes sure Mary states what she wants to do,
and he constantly summarizes and paraphrases what she is saying
to ensure that they are both on the same page.
By this point, Planner A should have all the data he needs
to incorporate into a financial plan for Mary that includes how
much she can withdraw each month to live on; an appropriate
investment policy; what, if anything, she plans to leave to her
heirs; and all other issues that have been identified by the client
during this process. The objective is for the client to address all
of her immediate and future concerns so that she is financially
prepared for every issue.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
At the conclusion of the interactive session, Planner A lets Mary
know when she can expect to hear from him again. On her way
out of the office, he suggests she meet with his assistant to set up a
return visit, and gives her a one- to two-week range as to when he
anticipates the plan will be ready for review.
Now that Planner A has all of his client’s information, his assis-
tant enters the raw data into the database. Based on the raw data,
Planner A will be in a good position to make recommendations,


```
Running an Integrated Practice
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
pick investments, allocate funds, assess the objectives, and tie
everything together to help create the opportunity for the client
to achieve her goals.
The balance sheet and cash flow statements developed through
this process provide Planner A with a good indication of what his
client can and cannot do financially. In Mary’s case, it can even
tell him whether she qualifies for Medicaid or another type of
subsidy. Planner A will see what assets there are to draw from and
how much annual income can be expected.
```
```
RECOMMENDING SOLUTIONS
When Mary returns to the office for the follow-up meeting, Plan-
ner A is firm when explaining the likelihood of success based on
the objectives Mary has stated and the resources she can depend
on. He gives Mary a highlighter and makes the first mark on the
financial plan to make the point that the plan should be used as a
road map, not placed on a shelf somewhere and never referred to
again. He tells Mary to highlight all the key information and mark
up the plan so it will be easier for her to use in the future.
Planner A explains whether Mary’s objectives are achievable
based on the circumstances he has uncovered. It may be neces-
sary to start over with some clients at this time, basically inform-
ing them that their existing or proposed scenario is not going
to work. Sometimes the client is shocked; other times they are
expecting it. But remember, Planner A is the realist. His job is
to help the client attain her goals, and this type of feedback can
be difficult for a client to accept. In Mary’s case, there are only
two choices: raise revenue or cut expenses. One way of increas-
ing revenue might be to assume the risk of reallocating assets
to a more aggressive portfolio. But that approach is inappropri-
ate for a client who is not psychologically prepared to handle
increased risk or radical changes. Such a client might react to
a brief market downturn by insisting on selling those assets,
defeating the plan’s purpose. In Mary’s case, a more aggressive
investing approach probably would not work. With her shorter
time horizon and an immediate need for cash, a conservative
approach is the most logical answer.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
The other option is to reduce Mary’s expenses by creating a
budget that will enable her to live a little less comfortably but with
the security that she won’t run out of assets. Planner A then looks
at Mary’s existing budget, determines which expenses are the
first to go, tinkers with others, and develops a new lower budget
that doesn’t require as large a return on investments and can be
stretched out over a longer period of time.

IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
The plan won’t be worth the paper it’s printed on unless it is put
into action. Therefore, Planner A provides a simple “to do” list for
the client, as follows:

This will serve as a starting point for items getting completed
every time they meet. Planner A goes through the list with Mary
to determine what has been done, and find out why things have
not been done. He ensures that these basic points get covered so

the client is protected and her situation is upgraded based on his
recommendations. They decide to meet either by phone or in
person every other month to ensure that things are getting done.
This is also Planner A’s chance to monitor progress and ask for
referrals.
```
```
MONITORING THE PLAN
Because things can change, it is imperative that the client’s situ-
ation is constantly reviewed. Mary is going to need attention to
ensure that any adjustments she needs to make are implemented.
After Planner A has met with her several times during the initial
process, a semiannual or annual meeting is warranted and should
be established in the engagement letter.
Planner A is now engaged in tweaking that plan to ensure that
the client stays on course. Therefore, the fee should be either a
percentage of what the client paid initially or a flat fee (perhaps
40 percent of what was initially charged). Most of the time-
consuming things were done initially; at this stage, Planner A is
refining the model already in place. And again, every time he
meets with Mary, he asks for referrals.
```
```
Case 2: Ben and Kate Wilson—
Professional Young Couple with Children
```
```
ben, age thirty-five, and Kate, age thirty-two, were a referral
from a client who works with Ben. Ben is an engineer, and Kate is
a homemaker, taking care of their three-year-old and one-year-old
children. Ben earns $80,000 per year and has limited benefits—
only health insurance and a 401(k) plan.
```
```
PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH A CLIENT
When Ben and Kate arrive at Planner B’s office, her reception-
ist gives them a simple twelve-question questionnaire (see EXHIBIT
3.2 on pages 76–77) to complete. The entire questionnaire takes
about ten minutes yet prepares Ben and Kate for the issues the
planner is about to raise. When Planner B greets Ben and Kate
in the waiting room, they are visibly nervous, having never under-
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
gone this process before. The closest they have come to a finan-
cial planning discussion is when they spoke informally to Kate’s
brother about purchasing life insurance.

INTEGRATED GOAL SETTING AND DATA GATHERING
Once they are seated in the conference room, Planner B explains
the purpose of financial planning. She tells the Wilsons it is a
long-term process that essentially helps someone get from Point
A to Point B. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme, nor is it about con-
sistently selecting the best-performing investments. It’s not a daily
activity but one that is measured over the long term. Planner B
tells them that the purpose of financial planning is to ensure that
they will have funds available when they need them, depending
on their particular objectives.
Planner B begins by asking a series of specific questions about
money. Where do they intend to go in life? How much do they
anticipate needing to accomplish all of their objectives? What’s
most important to them now? What are their priorities? It’s very
possible that Ben and Kate won’t achieve all of these; yet, if they
can attain several important ones, then Planner B’s help will be
worthwhile. That’s the importance of prioritizing. Essentially, the
plan is to make the objectives at the beginning of the list a reality,
and then, depending on their other circumstances, work toward
achieving the next set of objectives, and so forth. They seem
overwhelmed by all of this questioning, so Planner B explains the
importance of being very specific. Goals are open-ended broad
statements that give generalities. It’s more difficult to give specif-
ics, which are objectives, but they are definite and measurable.
This way accountability is established and specific needs can be
provided for properly.
The Wilsons have never discussed life insurance in a serious
way. Who will take care of their children if something unexpected
happens? They never thought about these issues when their chil-
dren were first born, because they were too busy taking care of
more immediate concerns. Planner B proceeds with her line of
questioning and determines all of their objectives, putting a price
tag on each in today’s dollars.


```

```
Planner B then tallies all of their objectives to quantify a grand
number for life insurance needs. For Ben, a reasonable estimate
of life insurance coverage is seven times his annual salary, or
$560,000. Since Kate does not draw a salary, calculating her life
insurance coverage requires a calculation of her “replacement
cost.” If Kate were to die, Ben would need to hire live-in help to
care for the kids and handle all the housekeeping duties. Since
Ben occasionally travels for business, overnight child care would
be warranted. If the cost of bringing in a live-in nanny is $35,000
per year, and the youngest child will not be attending college for
another seventeen years, and assuming the nanny gets a 5 per-
cent raise every year, then Planner B enters the following into the
financial calculator:
```
```
$35,000 PMT
17 N
5 1
```
```
The present value (PV) of that future payment stream equals
$394,592. So Kate’s life insurance requirement is roughly
$400,000.
Planner B next works through the disability income numbers
to ensure that they have coverage for 60 to 70 percent of their
gross income. Since Ben’s job doesn’t provide for long-term dis-
ability, disability insurance is an important objective that goes to
the top of the list. A ninety-day elimination period and benefits
payable to age sixty-five would be warranted for a professional like
Ben. He probably will be at or next to the highest classification for
determining disability benefits and premiums. There is a greater
concern about long-term disability since short-term disability
needs would be met through the ninety-day emergency fund the
Wilsons will create. Their health insurance coverage is provided
by Ben’s job. Because they are young, and because their resources
are not yet adequate to address this need, long-term care should
not be a concern for them at this time.
Their automobile insurance policy has a deductible of $250
and $500,000 liability coverage. Planner B tells them to raise
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
the deductible, since the odds of submitting a claim for that
little amount is far-fetched, considering that the raise in future
premiums will cost them more than what they would receive
from smaller claims. Planner B has them raise the deductible
to $1,000 to save a few hundred dollars annually on the pre-
mium. Planner B also notices that the $500,000 liability limit
does not coincide with their umbrella deductible of $1 million
from another insurer. Therefore, she suggests that Ben and Kate
raise this coverage amount to equal their underlying umbrella
deductible. After all, in the event of significant liability claims,
Planner B wants the payout to be seamless. That is, where the
underlying automobile liability coverage stops, the umbrella
policy kicks in. The umbrella policy will cover not only their
liability needs beyond their underlying policy limits but also
their defense costs associated with a lawsuit.
Their home owners coverage is also out of line. They just pur-
chased their dream house last year for $600,000. Planner B notices
that the home owners dwelling coverage (coverage A) is also for
$600,000. She tells the Wilsons that they have too much coverage;
based on the land-to-home value in their region, they should have
approximately $480,000 of coverage. Planner B explains that even
if the house burns down, the land will still be there; therefore, no
insurance coverage for the land is necessary. Ben and Kate lower
their dwelling amount to save money on the premium.
Many times planners see clients with _too little_ home owners
dwelling coverage. The rule of thumb is that insurance should
cover 80 percent of the appraised value of the property. For exam-
ple, if the clients’ house would cost $500,000 to rebuild and the
client currently has $300,000 of coverage A (dwelling coverage),
they are roughly $100,000 low on total coverage. It should be sug-
gested that the client bump up this coverage amount to $400,000
to ensure full coverage in the event of a loss. However, the land/
building ratio varies by region. Consult a real estate appraiser to
determine the property’s true value.
Planner B next has Ben and Kate create a budget, which is
something they have never done before. After analyzing their
entire situation, they are amazed at how much money they are

```

```
wasting and how inefficient their whole household budget has
become. They reallocate monies from discretionary expenditures
and reroute those dollars into savings and investments to target
the specific goals they have set out for themselves.
At this point, the infrastructure is in place and the investment
planning process can begin with the development of an invest-
ment policy statement. Risk and insurance issues must always be
covered first, without exception. The client must adequately plan
for becoming ill, being unable to work, losing a house, or dying
prematurely. Funds should always be set aside to cover these expo-
sures. If these risks are not accounted for properly in advance, the
client would have to raid any after-tax investments or retirement
accounts to cover them.
The investment analysis covers after-tax investing, retirement
(before-tax) investing, and saving for college. Planner B also
coordinates cash surrender values of their newly purchased life
insurance policies into the overall asset allocation.
Planner B then looks at their remaining documents to help
put together their estate plan and determine a retirement needs

```
analysis and any other analysis they may need. The estate-planning
documents might include the clients’ wills, trust documents,
deeds, and pre- or postnuptial agreements. On the retirement-
needs side, these documents would include an analysis of exist-
ing investments, a projection of potential revenue streams (such
as Social Security and pensions), and an analysis of what future
retirement expenses are likely to be incurred.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
These individual components are gathered to create a balance
sheet and cash flow statement that spells out where Ben and Kate
are and where they need to be. The results may be a little over-
whelming for them, since they have never seen an analysis like
this done for them before (see EXHIBITS 9.1 and 9.2).
Chances are Ben and Kate will be asset poor, in that their only
major asset is their house. Their net worth will also be low, due to
their huge mortgage balance. Drawing from other assets to ear-
mark them for future goals is a little premature at this point. Their
cash flow statement looks fine, since they have a sufficient amount
of money coming in, more than enough to cover expenses and a
surplus to invest. Planner B’s job is to invest that money in a way
that enables them to reach their known future goals.

RECOMMENDING SOLUTIONS
The recommendations Planner B has listed may have initially
seemed far-fetched given Ben and Kate’s immediate needs for
raising their two young children. But after this careful and thor-
ough analysis, Planner B helps the Wilsons put their options into
perspective. Planner B has helped them identify the key issues
and plan an appropriate course of action.
The following are some of the issues Planner B has identified
during their analysis, and suggestions for ways to explain recom-
mendations to clients:
◆ Saving for the children’s education should be a priority.
One way to do this is through the creation of a Section 529
educational savings account. With a 529 plan, monies grow tax-
deferred and can be distributed income-tax-free if used for col-


```
Running an Integrated Practice
```

```
lege. Significant amounts can be contributed to these accounts
(approximately $270,000 as of this writing), and the client can
take five annual gift tax exclusions up front ($55,000 on day
one, which is the current annual exclusion of $11,000 per year
for five years at the time of this writing). Different investment
options and many state plans’ state income tax deductions make
this a worthwhile choice.
◆ The Wilsons’ current amount of life insurance and disability
insurance stand out as insufficient. Planner B’s estimate should
include all of the objectives the family will want to accomplish if
Ben were to die today. The automobile and home owners insur-
ance serve as the underlying deductible for the umbrella (or
excess liability) policy, which is also a requirement. The umbrella
policy can provide additional protection against both serious and
frivolous lawsuits, since it covers the actual liability arising from
the claim and the costs of a defense.
```
```
With young children and new expenses, the Wilsons have not
saved as much as they need, nor have they paid attention to some
of their longer-term objectives, such as college tuition and retire-
ment. Their rationale has been that these other objectives are not
a true immediate concern, since they are not in sight for them
at this time. But nevertheless, Planner B needs to reiterate that
the only true path for achieving them is through a disciplined
approach beginning now.
```
```
IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
Planner B drafts a “to-do” sheet the Wilsons can follow to ensure
that all the items she has identified get done. This is their score-
card for getting things done in a timely manner. Any deviations
from this game plan will need to be addressed in future revisions
of the plan.
```
```
MONITORING THE PLAN
Ben and Kate will be undergoing much change over the next few
years as the children grow and additional funds will be needed
on their behalf. They will go into their peak earnings years, and
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
those newfound monies will need to be rerouted to ensure that
their infrastructure remains strong. Parents this age will probably
have an active social life, with mom-and-tot classes, sports leagues,
and the like. The Wilsons’ social contacts can lead to numerous
referrals, which Planner B requests.

```
Case 3: Ed and Tami Johnson—
Wealthy Married Couple Nearing Retirement
```
ed and tami, both age fifty-eight, have had Planner C’s name for
years. They’ve long meant to call her but have only now gotten
around to it. They have seen their children graduate from college,
settle down, and begin families of their own. Ed is an attorney who
is a partner with a large national law firm and earns $400,000 per
year. He’s been with the firm for twenty-five years. Tami works as
a teacher’s aide, has been with the school system for seventeen
years, and earns $30,000 per year. This highly active couple has a
sizable nest egg, and they want to begin enjoying their resources
and possibly assist their children down the road. But, as they will
tell Planner C, “Let’s not plan on those large inheritances for the
kids just yet. There is still a lot of living for us to do.”

PRELIMINARY MEETING WITH A CLIENT
Planner C’s assistant gives them the twelve-question questionnaire
to complete. Planner C meets them in the waiting area and invites
them back to the conference room. After small talk about what
they have accomplished, the Johnsons begin telling Planner C
about their objectives. Retirement is their big issue; they want to
retire in two years, at age sixty, while they are in good health. Ed
is concerned about giving up his big salary and making sure they
have things to occupy their time. Planner C informs them that they
have to plan for a retirement period equaling about one-third of
their lifetimes, or about thirty years. That’s a long time to be with-
drawing the funds they will have contributed primarily during the
previous thirty years, between the ages of thirty and sixty.
Another concern is taking care of Ed’s mother, whose care dur-
ing her remaining years they are partially responsible for funding.
Also, now that their kids are on their own, Tami and Ed want to
travel. They hope to vacation outside their metropolitan area fre-
quently throughout their retirement.
```
```
INTEGRATED GOAL SETTING AND DATA GATHERING
Now the key is to find sufficient funds to accomplish Ed and
Tami’s objectives. They tell Planner C that every objective is a
priority, and since retirement is only two years away, they want
to know what they can do now to achieve their objectives. When
Planner C asks if they have ever had a financial plan done for
them, they answer no. “Just never got around to it,” they further
reply. Planner C asks them about their house and their future
plans for residing there, downsizing, or possibly moving away,
perhaps to be closer to their kids. Two of their three children
live nearby, and the third lives a few hours away by car. They also
don’t want to leave their friends and Ed’s mom, so they plan to
use their house as home base for their adventures.
Planner C asks them about their wills and any other trust
documents. Their wills were set up thirty years ago, when
guardianship of their children was their key issue. A lot has
changed since then, considering they moved from a common-
law state to a community-property state. Planner C informs the
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
Johnsons that their wills need to be updated every three to five
years to ensure that their wishes are communicated exactly as
they want them to be.
Since at a glance it looks like their estate is over the “magic
threshold” where estate taxes will be due at death, Planner C begins
to discuss retitling certain assets and making use of irrevocable
trusts, including moving some insurance policies into irrevocable
life insurance trusts (ILITs). The Johnsons also have a concern
about paying estate taxes. They would like to leave money to their
children, if possible, but they won’t sacrifice the way they live during
retirement to do so. Since both of them are in good health, Planner
C tells them that she will investigate the feasibility of life insurance
on both to accomplish this goal. Some planners may also show their
clients a matrix of the recommended policy types and companies,
explaining the pros and cons of each, and letting them make the
ultimate choice. Premiums are compared, cash values are looked
at, expense ratios are analyzed, company ratings are reviewed, and
anything else that may concern them is addressed.
Ed’s mother is an ongoing concern, since she needs hands-on
care. So Planner C begins looking into an assisted-living facility
for her. She is too old for a long-term-care policy and not in the
best of health. Planner C tells them that she’ll investigate vari-
ous options for Ed’s mother. Finding the funds should not be an
issue, since Ed’s brother and sister have agreed to help with the
expense. Ed will do all the legwork and come out with a viable
recommendation for the entire family.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Planner C determines which retirement benefit works best given
their situation, since both have defined benefit plans. A matrix
will be drawn explaining the benefits under various scenarios.
Since Tami’s benefits would not be sufficient if Ed were to die
first, a joint-and-survivor benefit should be present. Planner C
works out several alternatives here to make sure she is in line with
the expenses they plan on incurring.
Planner C then consolidates their information into a balance
sheet and cash flow statement. She sees a net worth of about


```

```
$1.6 million, yet their current expenses total $15,000 per month
($180,000 per year). Based on Planner C’s analysis of what their
income will be during retirement and the amount they can begin
liquidating, she tells them their assets won’t be sufficient. Cut-
backs are needed. They have two choices: reduce expenses or
raise revenue through the reallocation of their current invest-
ments. The Johnsons choose to lower their expenses. Planner C
analyzes the cash flow statement’s discretionary expenses and find
several categories to remove and reduce.
```
```
RECOMMENDING SOLUTIONS
Planner C recommends that the Johnsons’ discretionary
expenses be reallocated into their investment portfolio. By
reviewing their objectives again, she helps the Johnsons reduce
their monthly expenditures to a more manageable $9,000
($108,000 per year). The key here is that this can be done with
minimal interruptions and little hassle. In essence, they won’t
miss these expenses. Work-related expenses, high-end vaca-
tions, and impulse buying are some of the things to be done
away with. These reductions will enable them to retire at age
sixty as planned.
Planner C provides a grid of assisted-living facilities for Ed’s
mom for several states based on cost, benefits, and transferability.
Planner C proceeds to go over them with the client, but the client
makes the final decision.
Planner C also provides the clients with a list of three attorneys
who specialize in estate planning so they can interview them all.
When they choose an attorney, Planner C seeks permission to
release a copy of the financial plan to the attorney so the attorney
can understand their background and the important issues sur-
rounding their decisions.
Based on their health and the newly found money from rear-
ranging their expenses, life insurance policies are needed to
handle any estate taxes that may arise. Planner C recommends
the policies be placed into an established irrevocable life insur-
ance trust (ILIT) to ensure that these policies’ death benefits will
not be part of any gross estate.
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
Since the clients’ time horizon is relatively short (two years till
retirement), actions need to be taken quickly. Monthly follow-ups
to ensure that tasks are met are a necessity. Planner C has the
Johnsons begin to allocate the time regularly into their schedules
to ensure that these items get done.
The assisted living for Ed’s mother is also key because there
could be a waiting period for entrance. If the period is too long,
alternative suggestions need to be developed, including contact-
ing Ed’s brother and sister for the possibility of all of them assum-
ing some responsibility until Ed’s mom is provided for. Ideally,
Ed and Tami want to ensure that this issue is taken care of before
their retirement; otherwise further reliance on Ed’s brother and
sister may be warranted.

MONITORING THE PLAN
Although Planner C has set up a plan for the Johnsons’ retire-
ment, that doesn’t mean it’s going to be carried out automati-
cally. The Johnsons are to cut their expenses drastically, and they
need to learn to live under these newly defined parameters, so
constant monitoring is essential.
Planner C meets with them quarterly in the beginning, then
semiannually. She reviews investment performance, annual

```
financial planners shoulder a huge responsibility. Clients
come to them for advice, guidance, and help with everything
they refuse to deal with themselves, don’t want to get involved
with, or simply don’t understand. A planner can be their guiding
light. A planner doesn’t dictate to them what to do, but rather
suggests ways they can accomplish their objectives, given their
particular circumstances. Planners should not make the final
decisions; rather, they should act as a sounding board and point
out to clients what steps they can take now to achieve long-term
success. When a planner works with sincerity, understanding,
and real-life compassion to help people maximize their current
situation and be the best they can be, the rewards of the profes-
sion are boundless.

also have support or specialty groups that discuss technical
and/or practice management issues. Members of these groups
are typically sincere, helpful, smart, and willing to share infor-

Tools for Your Practice

full-time planners benefit tremendously from automated tools
in the form of advanced financial planning software programs. It
may take you a while to learn the ins and outs of these tools, but
once you become familiar with some of them, you will have the
knowledge to go out and test others in order to locate the prod-
uct that best suits your practice. As with all computer technology,
this field is changing very rapidly. This section gives you a starting
point for evaluating these tools and choosing the ones that make
the most sense for you without sacrificing much time. It does not
represent an endorsement of any product or service.

Turnkey Programs

if you want to work within an established system that defines
every step of the financial planning, investment planning, and
management programs, you may want to consider a turnkey pro-
gram. In theory, just like with a car, you turn the key and it goes.
A turnkey program for an asset management system is called a
TAMP (turnkey asset management program). You contract with
a back-office operation to provide all the compliance, research,
and hand-holding you need. This type of program is good for the


```
Resources and Training
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
novice planner, but it does have drawbacks. You split part of your
fee with this back office every time you do business. Still, TAMPs
can get you up and running in a much shorter time than you can
probably do it on your own.
A turnkey program for personal financial planning services can
operate in a variety of ways. With one type you contract with a com-
pany that makes all the financial plans after you complete a data-
gathering form and submit it, either electronically or on paper, to
your turnkey provider. The company then enters the data, goes
over the numbers with you, and sends back a completed plan
within seventy-two hours. You present the plan to the clients. This
is a good approach for planners who want to be in front of clients
most of the time and have someone else be responsible for the
back-office work.
A second program takes over and provides plans for the clients
you refer. If you are licensed, you receive a part of the commis-
sion if your referral results in product sales. The benefit of this
approach is that you do not have to learn the business. The down-
side is that you will never make as much money as you likely will if
you do learn the business.
Still another approach is to form your own turnkey program.
Join forces with other planners, each with a particular specialty—
investment, retirement, insurance, estate planning—and a CPA
for income tax issues. Clients see the combination of profession-
als they need to address their needs. Most planners these days are
specialists, so this arrangement often works well.
```
```
Selecting a Software Program
buying a software program is not easy. It is a big investment and
requires a great deal of research before you write a check. Worse,
few or no programs will do exactly what you want, and you will
not know precisely how a program works until you use it for many
clients, even though you try out a demo.
To aid in the evaluation process, take a moment to consider the
following twenty questions before you buy a computer program.
1 What are the pros and cons of buying one integrated system
versus several programs separately to accomplish particular tasks?
```

```
GETTING STARTED AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER
```
2 Will you have to pay an annual support fee for this financial
planning software? What does that charge include?
3 What is involved when this software interfaces with another
program?
4 Does the software require third-party programs for operation?
If so, does this pose special issues to look out for?
5 What skills should you have to operate this financial planning
software program?
6 How much time should you expect to spend evaluating a
financial planning software program?
7 What trial period is available on this program?
8 How long does it take to get up to speed on this financial plan-
ning program?
9 What type of training is available and where?
10 What user groups exist for this software vendor? How much
weight should you give input from existing users?
11 Will this software vendor download data from the companies
you do business with on a client-by-client basis?
12 Will this vendor do a sample plan with you for one of your
clients?
13 Is this software bug free?
14 How often is the software updated?
15 How often should you expect to have to upgrade the hard-
ware?
16 Is a fact finder included? Can you modify it?
17 Can you copy the software and use it on different computers?
18 If you switch from Software X to Software Y, can you expect to
get your data from X to Y?
19 Is this software company likely to go out of business?
20 Will this software vendor be able to answer questions about
computer operation, aside from questions about its software
programs?

Contacting the Vendors

once you decide what type of software you want, the next step
is to contact vendors for a request for proposal (RFP). The RFP
lets you compare the programs. Send this or a similar form to the


```
Resources and Training
```

```
vendors, or visit the exhibit area at one of the many industrywide
conferences. Many of the software vendors listed in this chapter
will be there, and you will be able to get a personal demonstra-
tion of their programs.
The following questions are general—you may want to modify
them to reflect your needs.
◆ Software product
◆ Company
◆ Address
◆ Telephone number
◆ Fax number
◆ E-mail address
◆ Website
◆ Sales representative

Financial Planning Books
the following books cover many of the technical and/or
practice management aspects of personal financial planning.
Certainly, you can never have too much knowledge of a partic-
ular subject. You may want to develop a work habit of focusing
on a different part of your practice each month and looking
for a specific book in that area that can help take you to the
next level. The books listed below are groundbreakers in their
respective fields.

Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards
Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility
```
```
◆ Preamble and Applicability. The Code of Ethics and Professional
Responsibility (Code of Ethics) has been adopted by Certified Finan-
cial Planner Board of Standards Inc. (CFP Board) to provide
principles and rules to all persons whom it has recognized and
certified to use the CFP®, Certified Financial Planner™,^ and cer-
tification marks (collectively “the marks”). CFP Board determines
who is certified and thus authorized to use the marks. Implicit in
the acceptance of this authorization is an obligation not only to
comply with the mandates and requirements of all applicable laws
and regulations but also to take responsibility to act in an ethical
and professionally responsible manner in all professional services
and activities.
For purposes of this Code of Ethics, a person recognized and
certified by CFP Board to use the marks is called a CFP Board des-
ignee. This Code of Ethics applies to CFP Board designees actively
involved in the practice of personal financial planning, in other
```
CODE OF ETHICS AND

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY:

SECTION I

##### APPENDIX A

ANDARDS, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESER

VED


```
APPENDIX A
```
areas of financial services, in industry, in related professions, in
government, in education, or in any other professional activity
in which the marks are used in the performance of professional
responsibilities. This _Code of Ethics_ also applies to candidates for
the CFP® certification who are registered as such with CFP Board.
For purposes of this _Code of Ethics,_ the term _CFP Board designee_
shall be deemed to include current certificants, candidates, and
individuals who have been certified in the past and retain the
right to reinstate their CFP certification without passing the cur-
rent CFP® Certification Examination.
◆ Composition and Scope. The _Code of Ethics_ consists of two parts:
Part I—Principles and Part II—Rules. The Principles are state-
ments expressing in general terms the ethical and professional
ideals that CFP Board designees are expected to display in their
professional activities. As such, the Principles are aspirational
in character but are intended to provide a source of guidance
for CFP Board designees. The comments following each Prin-
ciple further explain the meaning of the Principle. The Rules in
Part II provide practical guidelines derived from the tenets
embodied in the Principles. As such, the Rules describe the stan-
dards of ethical and professionally responsible conduct expected
of CFP Board designees in particular situations. This _Code of Ethics_
does not undertake to define standards of professional conduct of
CFP Board designees for purposes of civil liability.
Due to the nature of a CFP Board designee’s particular field
of endeavor, certain Rules may not be applicable to that CFP
Board designee’s activities. For example, a CFP Board designee
who is engaged solely in the sale of securities as a registered rep-
resentative is not subject to the written disclosure requirements
of Rule 402 (applicable to CFP Board designees engaged in
personal financial planning) although he or she may have dis-
closure responsibilities under Rule 401. A CFP Board designee is
obligated to determine what responsibilities he or she has in each
professional relationship including, for example, duties that arise
in particular circumstances from a position of trust or confidence
that a CFP Board designee may have. The CFP Board designee is
obligated to meet those responsibilities.


```
CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
```
SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
The Code of Ethics is structured so that the presentation of the
Rules parallels the presentation of the Principles. For example,
the Rules which relate to Principle 1—Integrity are numbered
in the 100 to 199 series, while those Rules relating to Principle
2—Objectivity are numbered in the 200 to 299 series.
◆ Compliance. CFP Board requires adherence to this Code of
Ethics by all CFP Board designees. Compliance with the Code of
Ethics, individually and by the profession as a whole, depends on
each CFP Board designee’s knowledge of and voluntary compli-
ance with the Principles and applicable Rules, on the influence
of fellow professionals and public opinion, and on disciplinary
proceedings, when necessary, involving CFP Board designees who
fail to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code of Ethics.
```
```
Part I—Principles
these Code of Ethics Principles express the profession’s recogni-
tion of its responsibilities to the public, to clients, to colleagues,
and to employers. They apply to all CFP Board designees and pro-
vide guidance to them in the performance of their professional
services.
◆ Principle 1—Integrity. A CFP Board designee shall offer and pro-
vide professional services with integrity. As discussed in “Composi-
tion and Scope,” CFP Board designees may be placed by clients
in positions of trust and confidence. The ultimate source of such
public trust is the CFP Board designee’s personal integrity. In
deciding what is right and just, a CFP Board designee should rely
on his or her integrity as the appropriate touchstone. Integrity
demands honesty and candor which must not be subordinated to
personal gain and advantage. Within the characteristic of integ-
rity, allowance can be made for innocent error and legitimate
difference of opinion; but integrity cannot co-exist with deceit or
subordination of one’s principles. Integrity requires a CFP Board
designee to observe not only the letter but also the spirit of this
Code of Ethics.
◆ Principle 2—Objectivity. A CFP Board designee shall be objec-
tive in providing professional services to clients. Objectivity requires
intellectual honesty and impartiality. It is an essential quality for
```

```
APPENDIX A
```
any professional. Regardless of the particular service rendered
or the capacity in which a CFP Board designee functions, a CFP
Board designee should protect the integrity of his or her work,
maintain objectivity, and avoid subordination of his or her judg-
ment that would be in violation of this _Code of Ethics_.
◆ Principle 3—Competence. _A CFP Board designee shall provide
services to clients competently and maintain the necessary knowledge
and skill to continue to do so in those areas in which the CFP Board
designee is engaged._ One is competent only when he or she has
attained and maintained an adequate level of knowledge and
skill, and applies that knowledge effectively in providing services
to clients. Competence also includes the wisdom to recognize
the limitations of that knowledge and when consultation or
client referral is appropriate. A CFP Board designee, by virtue of
having earned the CFP® certification, is deemed to be qualified
to practice financial planning. However, in addition to assimi-
lating the common body of knowledge required and acquiring
the necessary experience for certification, a CFP Board designee
shall make a continuing commitment to learning and profes-
sional improvement.
◆ Principle 4—Fairness. _A CFP Board designee shall perform pro-
fessional services in a manner that is fair and reasonable to clients,
principals, partners, and employers, and shall disclose conflict(s) of
interest in providing such services._ Fairness requires impartiality,
intellectual honesty, and disclosure of conflict(s) of interest. It
involves a subordination of one’s own feelings, prejudices, and
desires so as to achieve a proper balance of conflicting interests.
Fairness is treating others in the same fashion that you would want
to be treated and is an essential trait of any professional.
◆ Principle 5—Confidentiality. _A CFP Board designee shall not dis-
close any confidential client information without the specific consent of
the client unless in response to proper legal process, to defend against
charges of wrongdoing by the CFP Board designee, or in connection
with a civil dispute between the CFP Board designee and client._ A cli-
ent, by seeking the services of a CFP Board designee, may be inter-
ested in creating a relationship of personal trust and confidence
with the CFP Board designee. This type of relationship can only


SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
```
```
be built upon the understanding that information supplied to the
CFP Board designee will be confidential. In order to provide the
contemplated services effectively and to protect the client’s pri-
vacy, the CFP Board designee shall safeguard the confidentiality
of such information.
◆ Principle 6—Professionalism. A CFP Board designee’s conduct
in all matters shall reflect credit upon the profession. Because of the
importance of the professional services rendered by CFP Board
designees, there are attendant responsibilities to behave with
dignity and courtesy to all those who use those services, fellow
professionals, and those in related professions. A CFP Board des-
ignee also has an obligation to cooperate with fellow CFP Board
designees to enhance and maintain the profession’s public image
and to work jointly with other CFP Board designees to improve
the quality of services. It is only through the combined efforts of
all CFP Board designees, in cooperation with other professionals,
that this vision can be realized.
◆ Principle 7—Diligence. A CFP Board designee shall act diligently
in providing professional services. Diligence is the provision of ser-
vices in a reasonably prompt and thorough manner. Diligence
also includes proper planning for, and supervision of, the render-
ing of professional services.
```
```
Part II—Rules
AS STATED IN Part I—Principles, the Principles apply to all CFP
Board designees. However, due to the nature of a CFP Board
designee’s particular field of endeavor, certain Rules may not
be applicable to that CFP Board designee’s activities. The uni-
verse of activities engaged in by a CFP Board designee is indeed
diverse, and a particular CFP Board designee may be performing
all, some, or none of the typical services provided by financial
planning professionals. As a result, in considering the following
Rules, a CFP Board designee must first recognize what specific
services he or she is rendering and then determine whether or
not a specific Rule is applicable to those services. To assist the CFP
Board designee in making these determinations, the Standards of
Professional Conduct includes a series of definitions of terminology
```

```
APPENDIX A
```
(see page 2) used throughout the _Code of Ethics._ Based upon these
definitions, a CFP Board designee should be able to determine
which services he or she provides and, therefore, which Rules are
applicable to those services.

RULES THAT RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEGRITY
◆ Rule 101. A CFP Board designee shall not solicit clients
through false or misleading communications or advertisements:
(a) _Misleading Advertising:_ A CFP Board designee shall not
make a false or misleading communication about the size, scope,
or areas of competence of the CFP Board designee’s practice or
of any organization with which the CFP Board designee is associ-
ated; and
(b) _Promotional Activities:_ In promotional activities, a CFP
Board designee shall not make materially false or misleading
communications to the public or create unjustified expectations
regarding matters relating to financial planning or the profession-
al activities and competence of the CFP Board designee. The term
“promotional activities” includes, but is not limited to, speeches,
interviews, books and/or printed publications, seminars, radio
and television shows, and videocassettes; and
(c) _Representation of Authority:_ A CFP Board designee shall not
give the impression that a CFP Board designee is representing
the views of CFP Board or any other group unless the CFP Board
designee has been authorized to do so. Personal opinions shall be
clearly identified as such.
◆ Rule 102. In the course of professional activities, a CFP Board
designee shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation, or knowingly make a false or mis-
leading statement to a client, employer, employee, professional
colleague, governmental or other regulatory body or official, or
any other person or entity.
◆ Rule 103. A CFP Board designee has the following responsibili-
ties regarding funds and/or other property of clients:
(a) In exercising custody of, or discretionary authority over, cli-
ent funds or other property, a CFP Board designee shall act only
in accordance with the authority set forth in the governing legal

instrument (e.g., special power of attorney, trust, letters testamen-
tary, etc.); and
(b) A CFP Board designee shall identify and keep complete
records of all funds or other property of a client in the custody, or
under the discretionary authority, of the CFP Board designee; and
(c) Upon receiving funds or other property of a client, a

by law or provided by agreement with the client, deliver to the
client or third party any funds or other property which the cli-
ent or third party is entitled to receive and, upon request by
the client, render a full accounting regarding such funds or
other property; and
(d) A CFP Board designee shall not commingle client funds or
other property with a CFP Board designee’s personal funds and/
or other property or the funds and/or other property of a CFP
Board designee’s firm. Commingling one or more clients’ funds
or other property together is permitted, subject to compliance
with applicable legal requirements and provided accurate records
are maintained for each client’s funds or other property; and
(e) A CFP Board designee who takes custody of all or any part
of a client’s assets for investment purposes, shall do so with the
care required of a fiduciary.
```
```
RULES THAT RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF OBJECTIVITY
◆ Rule 201. A CFP Board designee shall exercise reasonable
and prudent professional judgment in providing professional
services.
◆ Rule 202. A financial planning practitioner shall act in the
interest of the client.
```
```
RULES THAT RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETENCE
◆ Rule 301. A CFP Board designee shall keep informed of
developments in the field of financial planning and participate
in continuing education throughout the CFP Board designee’s
professional career in order to improve professional competence
in all areas in which the CFP Board designee is engaged. As a dis-
tinct part of this requirement, a CFP Board designee shall satisfy
```

```
APPENDIX A
```
all minimum continuing education requirements established for
CFP Board designees by CFP Board.
◆ Rule 302. A CFP Board designee shall offer advice only in
those areas in which the CFP Board designee has competence. In
areas where the CFP Board designee is not professionally compe-
tent, the CFP Board designee shall seek the counsel of qualified
individuals and/or refer clients to such parties.

RULES THAT RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS
◆ Rule 401. In rendering professional services, a CFP Board des-
ignee shall disclose to the client:
(a) Material information relevant to the professional relation-
ship, including conflict(s) of interest; the CFP Board designee’s
business affiliation, address, telephone number, credentials,
qualifications, licenses, compensation structure, and any agency
relationships; and the scope of the CFP Board designee’s author-
ity in that capacity; and
(b) The information required by all laws applicable to the rela-
tionship in a manner complying with such laws.
◆ Rule 402. A CFP Board designee in a financial planning
engagement shall make timely written disclosure of all material
information relative to the professional relationship. In all cir-
cumstances and prior to the engagement, a CFP Board designee
shall, in writing:
(a) Disclose conflict(s) of interest and sources of compensa-
tion; and
(b) Inform the client or prospective client of his/her right to
ask at any time for information about the compensation of the
CFP Board designee.
As a guideline, a CFP Board designee who provides a client or
prospective client with the following written disclosures, using
Form ADV, a CFP Board Disclosure Form, or an equivalent docu-
ment, will be considered to be in compliance with this Rule:
— The basic philosophy of the CFP Board designee (or firm)
in working with clients. This includes the philosophy, theory,
and/or principles of financial planning which will be uti-
lized by the CFP Board designee; and


SOURCE: BLOOMBERG PRESS

```
CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
```
```
— Résumés of principals and employees of a firm who are
expected to provide financial planning services to the client
and a description of those services. Such disclosures shall
include educational background, professional/employment
history, professional designations and licenses held; and
— A statement that in reasonable detail discloses (as appli-
cable) conflict(s) of interest and source(s) of, and any
contingencies or other aspects material to, the CFP Board
designee’s compensation; and
— A statement describing material agency or employment
relationships a CFP Board designee (or firm) has with third
parties and the nature of compensation resulting from such
relationships; and
— A statement informing the client or prospective client of
his or her right to ask at any time for information about the
compensation of the CFP Board designee.
◆ Rule 403. Upon request by a client or prospective client, the
CFP Board designee in a financial planning engagement shall
communicate in reasonable detail the requested compensation
information related to the financial planning engagement,
including compensation derived from implementation. The
disclosure may express compensation as an approximate dol-
lar amount or percentage or as a range of dollar amounts or
percentages. The disclosure shall be made at a time and to the
extent that the requested compensation information can be
reasonably ascertained. Any estimates shall be clearly identified
as such and based on reasonable assumptions. If a CFP Board
designee becomes aware that a compensation disclosure pro-
vided pursuant to this rule has become significantly inaccurate,
he or she shall provide the client with corrected information in
a timely manner.
◆ Rule 404. The disclosures required of a CFP Board designee in
a financial planning engagement described under Rule 402 shall
be offered at least annually for current clients, and provided if
requested.
◆ Rule 405. A CFP Board designee’s compensation shall be fair
and reasonable.
```

```
APPENDIX A
```
◆ Rule 406. A CFP Board designee who is an employee shall per-
form professional services with dedication to the lawful objectives
of the employer and in accordance with this _Code of Ethics_.
◆ Rule 407. A CFP Board designee shall:
(a) Advise his/her employer of outside affiliations which rea-
sonably may compromise service to an employer;
(b) Provide timely notice to his or her employer and clients
about change of CFP® certification status; and
(c) Provide timely notice to clients, unless precluded by con-
tractual obligations, about change of employment.
◆ Rule 408. A CFP Board designee shall inform his or her
employer, partners, or co-owners of compensation or other ben-
efit arrangements in connection with his or her services to clients,
which are in addition to compensation from the employer, part-
ners, or co-owners for such services.
◆ Rule 409. If a CFP Board designee enters into a personal business
transaction with a client, separate from regular professional services
provided to that client, the transaction shall be on terms which
are fair and reasonable to the client and the CFP Board designee
shall disclose, in writing, the risks of the transaction, conflict(s) of
interest of the CFP Board designee, and other relevant informa-
tion, if any, necessary to make the transaction fair to the client.

RULES THAT RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF CONFIDENTIALITY
◆ Rule 501. A CFP Board designee shall not reveal—or use for
his or her own benefit—without the client’s consent, any person-
ally identifiable information relating to the client relationship or
the affairs of the client, except and to the extent disclosure or use
is reasonably necessary:
(a) To establish an advisory or brokerage account, to effect a
transaction for the client, or as otherwise impliedly authorized in
order to carry out the client engagement; or
(b) To comply with legal requirements or legal process; or
(c) To defend the CFP Board designee against charges of
wrongdoing; or
(d) In connection with a civil dispute between the CFP Board
designee and the client.

CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
```
```
For purposes of this rule, the proscribed use of client informa-
tion is improper whether or not it actually causes harm to the
client.
◆ Rule 502. A CFP Board designee shall maintain the same stan-
dards of confidentiality to employers as to clients.
◆ Rule 503. A CFP Board designee doing business as a partner
or principal of a financial services firm owes the CFP Board desig-
nee’s partners or co-owners a responsibility to act in good faith.
This includes, but is not limited to, adherence to reasonable
expectations of confidentiality both while in business together
and thereafter.
```
```
RULES THAT RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF
PROFESSIONALISM
◆ Rule 601. A CFP Board designee shall use the marks in compli-
ance with the rules and regulations of CFP Board, as established
and amended from time to time.
◆ Rule 602. A CFP Board designee shall show respect for other
financial planning professionals, and related occupational groups,
by engaging in fair and honorable competitive practices. Collegi-
ality among CFP Board designees shall not, however, impede
enforcement of this Code of Ethics.
◆ Rule 603. A CFP Board designee who has knowledge, which
is not required to be kept confidential under this Code of Eth-
ics, that another CFP Board designee has committed a violation
of this Code of Ethics which raises substantial questions as to the
designee’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a CFP Board
designee in other respects, shall promptly inform CFP Board.
This rule does not require disclosure of information or reporting
based on knowledge gained as a consultant or expert witness in
anticipation of, or related to, litigation or other dispute resolu-
tion mechanisms. For purposes of this rule, knowledge means no
substantial doubt.
◆ Rule 604. A CFP Board designee who has knowledge, which is
not required under this Code of Ethics to be kept confidential, and
which raises a substantial question of unprofessional, fraudulent,
or illegal conduct by a CFP Board designee or other financial
```

```
APPENDIX A
```
professional, shall promptly inform the appropriate regulatory
and/or professional disciplinary body. This rule does not require
disclosure or reporting of information gained as a consultant or
expert witness in anticipation of, or related to, litigation or other
dispute resolution mechanisms. For purposes of this Rule, knowl-
edge means no substantial doubt.
◆ Rule 605. A CFP Board designee who has reason to suspect
illegal conduct within the CFP Board designee’s organization
shall make timely disclosure of the available evidence to the
CFP Board designee’s immediate supervisor and/or partners or
co-owners. If the CFP Board designee is convinced that illegal
conduct exists within the CFP Board designee’s organization,
and that appropriate measures are not taken to remedy the situ-
ation, the CFP Board designee shall, where appropriate, alert
the appropriate regulatory authorities, including CFP Board, in
a timely manner.
◆ Rule 606. In all professional activities a CFP Board designee
shall perform services in accordance with:
(a) Applicable laws, rules, and regulations of governmental
agencies and other applicable authorities; and
(b) Applicable rules, regulations, and other established poli-
cies of CFP Board.
◆ Rule 607. A CFP Board designee shall not engage in any con-
duct which reflects adversely on his or her integrity or fitness as a
CFP Board designee, upon the marks, or upon the profession.
◆ Rule 608. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires
registration of investment advisers with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, and similar state statutes may require
registration with state securities agencies. CFP Board designees
shall disclose to clients their firms’ status as registered investment
advisers. Under present standards of acceptable business conduct,
it is proper to use registered investment adviser if the CFP Board
designee is registered individually. If the CFP Board designee is
registered through his or her firm, then the CFP Board designee
is not a registered investment adviser but a person associated
with an investment adviser. The firm is the registered investment
adviser. Moreover, RIA or R.I.A. following a CFP Board designee’s

name in advertising, letterhead stationery, and business cards may
be misleading and is not permitted either by this Code of Ethics
or by SEC regulations.
◆ Rule 609. A CFP Board designee shall not practice any other
profession or offer to provide such services unless the CFP Board
designee is qualified to practice in those fields and is licensed as
required by state law.
◆ Rule 610. A CFP Board designee shall return the client’s
original records in a timely manner after their return has been
requested by a client.
◆ Rule 611. A CFP Board designee shall not bring or threaten to
bring a disciplinary proceeding under this Code of Ethics, or report
or threaten to report information to CFP Board pursuant to Rules
603 and/or 604, or make or threaten to make use of this Code of
Ethics for no substantial purpose other than to harass, maliciously
injure, embarrass, and/or unfairly burden another CFP Board
designee.
◆ Rule 612. A CFP Board designee shall comply with all appli-
cable renewal requirements established by CFP Board including,
but not limited to, payment of the biennial CFP Board designee
fee as well as signing and returning the Terms and Conditions of
Certification in connection with the certification renewal process.

the following statistics are from the _2003 FPA Compensa-
tion and Staffing Survey._ The survey was done by The Financial
Planning Association in cooperation with Moss Adams, LLP, the
tenth largest CPA firm in the nation. The overall conclusion of the
study is that the financial advisory community is becoming more
sophisticated in the development of its human capital plan. For
more information about the FPA, membership opportunities, or

or contact them at 800-322-4237.

Recruiting and Retention

◆ During the past two years, advisory practices increased full-time
staffing by 15 percent.
◆ Firms are becoming more sophisticated and careful in their
recruiting. More than half (51.9 percent) of the multiprofessional
(ensemble) firms use tests to screen their prospective employees.
◆ More than three-quarters (78.4 percent) of all firms conduct
employee evaluations, 14.9 percent use upstream evaluations, and
12.6 percent use peer evaluations.

AND COMPENSATION

##### APPENDIX B


```
APPENDIX B
```
◆ Firms continue to invest heavily in their employees; 86.2
percent reimburse some education expenses.

Staffing Models: Smaller Firms

◆ Advisory firms are typically solo practices with a median of one
administrative staff member and one support person.
◆ The principals/owners of advisory practices typically hold a
CFP Certificate (43.9 percent). Other common designations
held by principals include ChFC (18.2 percent) and CLU (18.2
percent).
◆ CFP certificate holders who practice as planners and paraplan-
ners earn more than their noncertificate counterparts.
◆ The typical adviser works with 75 to 190 clients and generates a
median of $2,500 in revenue per client relationship.
◆ 90.9 percent offer investment policy decisions and perform
buying and selling of securities on behalf of their clients.
◆ 59.1 percent offer securities trading, such as brokerage
accounts.
◆ 74.2 percent offer portfolio administration.
◆ 69.7 percent offer investment research.

Staffing Models: Larger Firms

the largest firms achieve their size by:
◆ Merging practices together to reach critical mass and create
overhead efficiency
◆ Standardizing client delivery processes and including support
staff to achieve leverage
◆ Employing non-owner professionals to further increase the
capabilities of the practice and to further leverage the reputation
of the firm
◆ Institutionalizing their brand, systems, and human resource
practices

Elite Firms and Virtuoso Practices

the top 25 percent of ensemble firms (as measured by pretax
income per owner) are termed “elite.” The top 25 percent of solo
practices (as measured by pretax income per owner) are termed

```
“virtuoso.” Both elite and virtuoso firms exhibit clear characteris-
tics that have contributed to their success:
◆ The median operating profit per client of an elite firm is ten
times that of other firms, at $1,440. The median assets per client
for an elite firm approaches $850,000, compared to $350,000 for
other firms.
◆ Virtuoso practices generate $1,050 of operating profit per cli-
ent versus $194 for their peers, with $290,000 of assets per client
contrasting with $125,000 for their peers.
◆ Elite firms have roughly three times the assets under manage-
ment than that of other firms, and virtuoso firms have approxi-
mately two times the assets under management than that of other
firms.
◆ Elite firms have more than 2.5 times the revenue of other
ensembles at $1.3 million.
◆ Elite firm owners generate 3.5 times the pretax income of
other ensemble firms.
◆ Elite firms in particular have captured a much wealthier client
base.
◆ Both elite and virtuoso firms have several more years of experi-
ence in the advisory business than their peers.
