# Sec. 39-293. Purpose of districts.

(a) The B-1 Limited Commercial Business District is intended to meet the personal service needs of the local neighborhood. Such districts are primarily located on a local collector road, contiguous to residentially-zoned properties, rather than a major thoroughfare. All activities of permitted uses are limited to the interior of a building, except as specifically permitted in section 39-300, "Limitations of uses."

(b) The B-2 General Commercial Business District is intended to meet the shopping and service needs of several residential neighborhoods or a substantial residential area. B-2 districts are primarily located on a major thoroughfare or arterial catering to vehicular traffic. All activities of permitted uses are limited to the interior of a building, except as specifically permitted in section 39-300, "Limitations of uses."

(c) The B-3 Intense Commercial Business District is intended primarily to accommodate establishments and services catering to the business and industrial community and for services not used by residents on a regular basis. Such districts are not appropriate for locations which are contiguous to residential properties. Due to the size of permissible items which may be sold or maintained, display and storage are permitted outside.

(d) The B-4 Commercial Redevelopment Overlay Districts are intended to provide incentives for redevelopment of older, commercial areas which have experienced a decline in occupancy, maintenance and economic viability.

(e) The C-1 Commercial Warehouse District is intended for certain repair and maintenance services, wholesale, storage and warehouse uses, and sales or rental of large or heavy machinery and equipment. Such districts serve a regional clientele or nearby industrial areas and do not cater to residential areas or pedestrian traffic.

(f) The CR Commercial Recreation District is intended to accommodate major public and private commercial recreation facilities which offer opportunities to residents and tourists.

(g) The OP Office Park District is intended to encourage the location of planned office complexes and corporate headquarters in a campus-like atmosphere with substantial buildings and ample open space, including limited services for employees such as shopping and food service establishments.

In B-1, B-2, B-4, RO, and OP districts, all products displayed for sale shall be located within a building, except that produce, plants, and lawn and garden equipment may be displayed and stored outside in an area designated on an approved site plan, provided the display and storage area is located at least fifty (50) feet from any residentially-zoned plot and is not within any required landscape buffer. Such outside display areas shall be enclosed with a fence at least six (6) feet in height. At least one (1) side of the display and storage area shall be contiguous to the principal building to which it is accessory. Stocking of the produce or plants or pick-up by customers shall be done internally or through a single gate at the designated offstreet loading area.

(c) _Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures_. Dumpsters located on any property in a commercial zoning district shall comply with the following:

(1) Dumpsters shall be kept within opaque or translucent enclosures and shall be located at least five (5) feet inside any plot line; however, no dumpster or dumpster enclosure shall be located in a required setback or buffer area, unless a street or dedicated alley separates the commercial plot from any adjacent residential property.

(2) Dumpsters shall be maintained free of jagged or sharp edges or inside parts which could prevent the free discharge of their contents.

(3) Dumpsters shall be emptied by a licensed collector at intervals which will preclude overflow. Dumpsters and the area around the dumpster and dumpster enclosure shall not be used for disposal of furniture and major appliances and shall be maintained by the property owner free of overflowing refuse at all times. If a continuous problem of insufficient dumpster capacity is proven to exist, additional or larger capacity dumpsters and enclosures or increased frequency of pick-up shall be required in order to eliminate the overflow problem.

(4) All dumpster pads shall be at least two (2) feet larger than the dumpster on all sides. Wheel stops or posts shall be permanently affixed to the pad at least one foot inside the perimeter of the pad to prevent the dumpster from striking the enclosure during collection.

(5) Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures shall be located in a position accessible for collection by the equipment of the collector.

(6) The dumpster enclosure shall be constructed so as to accommodate recycling bins, if the recycling bins are over forty (40) gallons.

(7) The gates of the enclosure shall be constructed of a frame with opaque or translucent walls affixed thereto, and both frame and walls shall be of a material of sufficient strength to withstand normal use. Gates shall be attached to metal posts at least three (3) inches in diameter with at least two (2) hinges. Each gate shall have a wheel at the bottom to prevent sagging and shall have drop pins or rods to hold the gates in place in both open and closed positions.

(8) The base of the enclosure must be poured concrete, in accordance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code. The base shall extend three (3) feet beyond the front opening of the enclosure as an apron, and all concrete must be level with the adjacent surface.

(d) _Landscaping._ All buildings and uses shall provide landscaping in accordance with Article VIII of this chapter, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity."

(e) _Offstreet parking._ All buildings and uses shall provide offstreet parking, loading areas and lighting in accordance with Article XII of this Chapter, "Offstreet Parking and Loading," except as provided for B-4 Commercial Redevelopment Overlay Districts.

(f) _Setbacks and buffers between commercial business and residential districts._

(1) Except for CR Commercial Recreation districts, the minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, in any commercial zoning district which is contiguous to a residentially-zoned plot in separate ownership, shall be twenty-five (25) feet from such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. A landscape buffer as required by Article VIII, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity," shall be provided within the setback area, including a visual barrier in the form of a fence, wall, or hedge a minimum of six (6) feet in height, constructed or planted and maintained as provided in Subsection (7) following.

(2) Except for CR Commercial Recreation districts, the minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, in any commercial zoning district which is separated from a residentially-zoned plot by a street, dedicated alley, canal, water area, railroad right-of-way, or public open space, shall be ten (10) feet from any such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. The entire setback area shall be a landscape buffer as required by Article VIII of this chapter, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity," crossed only by pedestrian walkways and driveways necessary for ingress and egress to and from the plot.

(3) No building or structure, except fences and walls, shall be erected or maintained in any CR Commercial Recreation district closer than one hundred (100) feet from any plot line.

(4) No building or structure shall be erected or maintained within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersection of two streets, nor within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of any driveway and street, except as permitted in subsection (7) following.

(5) The setback areas in OP Office Park districts shall be double the sizes specified in subsections (1) and (2) above.

(6) The setbacks required by this section shall also apply to those unincorporated lands which abut a municipal jurisdiction. Such setbacks shall be applied in the same manner as if the municipal lands were unincorporated lands.

(7) Fences, walls and hedges may be erected or planted and maintained within the setback to a maximum height of eight (8) feet, except in vehicular use areas. Fences and walls shall be translucent. Hedges used as a required visual barrier shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height at time of planting and shall be of a species which will reach a height of at least six (6) feet within two years after planting. Open-weave or chain link fences may only be used if appropriate landscape material, in accordance with Article VIII, is planted along such fence, which, after planting, will obscure the fence and provide a translucent barrier within one year after planting. Within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersection of two streets or within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of a private accessway and a street no fencing may be erected or maintained. The use of barbed wire, razor wire or electrified fencing shall be prohibited.

(h) _Use of residentially-zoned property for access._ No privately owned land or public or private street that directly abuts the front yards of residentially-zoned properties shall be used for driveway or vehicular access purposes to any plot in a commercial district, except where a public street provides the sole access to the commercial property.

(i) _Use of premises without buildings._ All permitted uses shall be conducted from a building on the plot which building shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) square feet in floor area and which shall contain permanent sanitary facilities.

(m) _Miscellaneous provisions._ In addition to general provisions herein, commercial business districts shall also be subject to Article IX, "General Provisions," of this Chapter.

(n) _Design standards._

(1) _General purpose and intent._ Commercial districts are predominantly located along major roadways with high-traffic volumes and visibility. The corridors serve as gateways to the residential neighborhoods and largely establish a community's image. Broward County recognizes it has a responsibility to provide a safe and desirable public realm and that the success of both the residential and commercial districts is related to the provision of high-quality urban design. The intent of the design standards is to regulate the design of individual buildings and structures. The design standards are further intended to synchronize with redevelopment projects. Implementation of the design standards implementation is not intended to have the effect of precluding the redevelopment, reuse, or repurposing of existing buildings and structures through strict application.

(2) _Applicability._ With the exception of properties zoned C-1, Commercial Warehouse District, or CR, Commercial Recreation District, the design standards shall apply to all properties zoned Commercial pursuant to Chapter 39, Article XVII, of the Code, as set forth herein:

a. All new construction of buildings, structures, and additions for which a development permit is obtained after February 26, 2018, shall fully comply with the design standards of this Section 39-294;

b. Except as provided in Subsection e. below, the design standards shall not apply to façade improvement projects that do not affect the rest of the site, and such projects shall not require site plan approval per the Broward County Code of Ordinances;

c. The design standards shall not apply to signs that are regulated by Chapter 39, Article VI, of the Zoning Code;

d. Where additions to an existing building or structure result in an increase of fifty (50) percent or more of the existing floor area, or improvements to the existing building or structure result in an increase of fifty (50) percent or more of the appraised value of the existing building or structure, as determined by the Broward County Property Appraiser, the existing building or structure and the addition(s) shall fully comply with the design standards; and

e. Where the improvements to a building or structure only involve façade improvements, result in an increase of less than fifty (50) percent of the appraised value of the existing building or structure, as determined by the Broward County Property Appraiser, or where additions to a building or structure result in an increase of floor area of less than fifty (50) percent of the existing floor area, the property owner shall comply with the design standards as much as reasonably possible to increase the level of conformity, as determined by the Director or designee. To enable this determination, the property owner shall submit a proposed design plan for consideration by the Director or designee that demonstrates the following:

1. That the design plan generally conforms with the purpose and intent of the design standards;

2. That each variation from the design standards is necessitated by an existing condition;

3. That each variation from the design standards is in the minimum amount reasonably necessary to address the existing condition; and

4. That there are unique and special circumstances or conditions applicable to the property in question, or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties in the same district.

(3) _Administrative Amendment._ The Urban Planning Division Director, or designee, may approve adjustments to colors that are consistent with the approved design.

(4) _Definitions._

a. _Accent color_ shall mean the color used on wall signs, awnings, and doors.

b. _Banding_ shall mean horizontal subdivisions of a wall accomplished through a change in profile or a change in materials.

c. _Base color_ shall mean the color used on the majority of a building's vertical surface.

d. _Building elements_ shall mean parts of a building such as walls, bandings, cornices, moldings, parapets, windows, awnings, canopies, roofs, doorjambs, frames, sills, shutters, or fasciae.

e. _Cornice_ shall mean a horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building, door, or window.

f. _Material_ shall mean the composition of building elements such as metal, brick, stone, wood, and concrete.

g. _Molding_ shall mean a decorative raised surface along the edge of an architectural feature such as a wall, door, window, or column.

h. _Parapet_ shall mean a low wall or barrier at the edge of the roof.

![](RackMultipart20230502-1-gej41s_html_7a4ff669d973728d.png)

i. _Texture_ shall mean the surface characteristics, grains, and patterns of a material, such as striped, blocked, pebbled, brushed, or smooth.

j. _Transom light_ shall mean a flat glass panel above a door, usually multipaned.

k. _Trim color_ shall mean the color used on windows or doorjambs, frames, sills, shutters, or fasciae.

(5) _Visual interest._ To avoid monotony of design, front and street side exterior walls consisting of a single undifferentiated plane with a single color or texture are prohibited. Differentiation may be achieved by using a combination of ornamentation, pattern, and composition as listed below:

| Type | Minimum Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Ornamentation and form | At least one (1) of the following:
  a. Building and door cornices; or
  b. Building cornices and door and window awnings or canopies; and
 At least one (1) of the following:
  a. Trim and sill work; or
  b. Columns and banding. |
| Colors | a. Buildings shall have one (1) base and one (1) trim color.
 b. One (1) additional accent color is permitted but not required. |
| Materials and textures | Buildings shall have at least two (2) materials or textures. |

(6) _Roofs._ For new construction, including new buildings and new additions, flat roofs shall be designed with parapets at least forty-two (42) inches high on all façades.

(7) _Windows, doors, and entrances._

a. At least one (1) entrance door of each building shall face the arterial or collector roadway and be emphasized through features such as moldings, arches, transom lights, sidelights, or tilework.

b. Entrances from the sidewalk shall be inset to allow doors to open without encroaching upon the sidewalk. The Zoning official may waive this requirement where an existing building is being renovated and the requirement is deemed infeasible, based on the design of the existing building.

c. Blank or windowless elevations that face public streets are prohibited. Walls that do not include window glazing or storefront entrances shall be articulated by the provision of faux windows trimmed with frames, sills, lintels, awnings, murals, or similar elements.

d. First floor windows shall consist of clear glass and shall occupy at least forty percent (40%) of the first floor front and street-side elevations that face public streets. Glass shall be a minimum of eighteen (18) inches above the sidewalk.

(8) _Outdoor equipment._ Except for rooftop photovoltaic solar systems installed in accordance with Section 39-109 of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, all heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical, mechanical, and similar equipment shall be completely screened from view or isolated so as to not be visible from any adjacent public right-of-way or residential zoning district. Any screening shall be designed to maintain a uniform appearance with the rest of the building.

(9) _Prohibitions._ Neon tubing as well as neon, fluorescent, iridescent, metallic, and similar colors in paint, fabric, and other materials are prohibited.

(o) _Setback Waiver._ Required setback distances set forth herein shall be waived by ten percent (10%) up to a maximum of one (1) foot for any existing and completed commercial building or structure that exists prior to February 26, 2018.
