### ARTICLE X. PROPERTY MAINTENANCE
# 1

# Sec. 39-130. Title, purpose, and intent.

This article shall be known as the Property Maintenance Code. It is found and declared that lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration of properties have the effect of creating conditions of slum and blight. Such conditions, if unabated, will expand and necessitate the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate them. It is hereby found and declared that there are properties within Broward County which are, or may become in the future, public nuisances. It is the intent of this article to establish property maintenance standards to prevent or abate the following conditions:

(1) Property deterioration;

(2) Failure to maintain exterior surfaces and yard areas;

(3) Insect and rodent infestation;

(4) Improper storage of household items; and

(5) Existence of fire hazards and unsanitary conditions which constitute a menace to the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

(a) The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by:

(1) Establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance, condition, and occupancy of residential and nonresidential premises;

(2) Establishing minimum standards governing structures and other physical components and conditions essential to make structures fit for human habitation, occupancy, and use;

(3) Establishing certain responsibilities and duties for property owners, occupants, and operators;

(4) Authorizing and establishing enforcement and abatement procedures which afford property owners due process under the law;

(5) Establishing penalties for the violations of this Code; and

(6) Providing for the repair, demolition, or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation, occupancy, or use.

(b) This article shall not be construed to:

(1) Discourage property owners from planting, preserving, or maintaining native vegetation in its natural state upon their land; or

(2) Prohibit the collection of garbage or recyclable materials in authorized receptacles by authorized garbage and trash collectors or authorized collectors of recyclable materials; nor the placement of debris in the swale area for a reasonable time, not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours prior to the date for a special bulk collection by an authorized garbage or trash collector; or

(3) Require clearing activities in violation of Chapter 5, Article XII, Broward County Code of Ordinances, "Natural Resource Areas;" or

(4) Prohibit, restrict, regulate, or otherwise limit any activity of a bona fide farm operation on land classified as agricultural land pursuant to Section 193.461, Florida Statutes, where such activity is regulated through implemented best-management practices or interim measures developed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, or water management districts and adopted pursuant to Chapter 120, Florida Statutes, as part of a statewide or regional program; or

(5) Prohibit, restrict, regulate, or otherwise limit any activity of a farm operation, as defined in Section 39-4 so long as such activity has not been determined to be a nuisance pursuant to Section 39-132.

(c) In order to restore, enhance, and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of residents of the unincorporated areas of Broward County and promote an attractive community in which people may reside and do business, this article is intended to apply to all existing buildings, structures, and lands within unincorporated Broward County, without regard to the use, date of construction, improvement, or alteration.

# Sec. 39-132. Public nuisances.

(a) It is declared unlawful and a public nuisance for an owner of any property to maintain or permit the open storage or discarding of abandoned property, junk vehicles and vessels, derelict aircraft, junk items, debris, garbage, trash, and litter, except in facilities approved by Broward County for storage or discarding of such items or materials; the maintenance of overgrown groundcover or vegetation; unmaintained buildings; and unsecured vacant buildings within unincorporated Broward County. Such conditions, storage, and discarding have been determined by the Board of County Commissioners to constitute a public nuisance in that such items create an eyesore to the community, become a breeding ground for rats and other vermin, create an attractive nuisance to children, lead to the further accumulation of junk, garbage, trash, litter, and debris, threaten or endanger the public health, safety, and welfare, and contribute to the deterioration of both residential and nonresidential areas.

(b) The Board of County Commissioners has determined that the County's removal of overgrown groundcover and hedges, junk items, trash, garbage, litter, and debris, after providing notice to the property owner and a reasonable period of time in which to remove the items, is an appropriate means of furthering the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Broward County.

(c) The Board of County Commissioners has determined that the removal and destruction of junk vehicles and vessels and derelict aircraft from private property, the removal and sale of junk vehicles, items, vessels, and derelict aircraft from airport property, and the abatement of unsecured vacant buildings, after the reasonable opportunity for a hearing, is an appropriate means of furthering the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Broward County.

(d) Farm operations located on that portion of a plot or plots of land located in agricultural, rural, and estate districts which have been classified as agricultural pursuant to Section 193.461, Florida Statutes, or the use of which has been determined to be a farm pursuant to an administrative determination of the zoning official or a final order of a hearing officer or court of law in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, which has been in existence for one (1) year or more since its established date of operation, and which was not a nuisance at the time of its established date of operation, shall constitute a public or private nuisance if the farm operation does not conform to generally accepted agricultural and management practices or if it is determined by the code enforcement hearing officer that any of the following conditions exist:

(1) The presence of untreated or improperly treated human waste, garbage, offal, dead animals, dangerous waste materials, or gases which are harmful to human or animal life.

(2) The presence of improperly built or improperly maintained septic tanks, water closets, or privies.

(3) The keeping of diseased animals which are dangerous to human health, unless such animals are kept in accordance with a current state or federal disease control program.

(4) The presence of unsanitary places where animals are slaughtered, which may give rise to diseases which are harmful to human or animal life.

(e) No farm operation shall become a public or private nuisance as a result of a change in ownership, a change in the type of farm product being produced, a change in conditions in or around the locality of the farm, or a change brought about to comply with Best Management Practices adopted by local, state, or federal agencies if such farm has been in operation for one (1) year or more since its established date of operation and if it was not a nuisance at the time of its established date of operation.

(f) The expansion of a farm operation will not be permitted to a more excessive farm operation with regard to noise, odor, dust, or fumes where the existing farm operation is adjacent to an established homestead or business on March 15, 1982.

(Ord. No. 1999-45, § 9, 8-24-99; Ord. No. 2001-18, § 7, 5-22-01; Ord. No. 2005-17, § 9, 6-28-05; Ord. No. 2016-30 , § 3, 10-25-16)

# Sec. 39-133. Duty to maintain property; nuisances.

(a) It shall be the responsibility of all property owners in the unincorporated area of Broward County to maintain their property and contiguous swale free of abandoned property, junk vehicles and vessels, junk items, garbage, trash, litter, debris, and unmaintained or unsecured buildings.

(b) The open storage of debris, garbage, trash, litter, junk vehicles and vessels or derelict aircraft shall be permitted only on property where such storage is a permitted use or a valid nonconforming use and the property is maintained and operated in accordance with all applicable zoning, health, and environmental regulations.

(c) Junk vehicles and vessels and junk items may be stored on residential property only within a completely enclosed building in a manner so that the junk is not visible from other public or private property and does not create a health hazard. Such storage shall only be permitted as an accessory use.

(d) In developed areas, it shall be the responsibility of all owners of undeveloped parcels of land one (1) net acre or less and developed parcels of land to maintain such lands and contiguous swales free of overgrown hedges and groundcover. This provision shall not apply to land or parcels of land located in rural, estate and agricultural districts.

Any boarded-up or covered door and window coverings shall be painted to match the remainder of the building.

(3) _Accessory structures._ Any accessory structure on a plot, including attached or detached carports and garages, awnings, screen porches, utility buildings, and wood decks shall be maintained free of visual disrepair, including bent, broken or missing fence posts, slats or other fencing materials, cut or missing mesh screening or broken or missing decking materials. Concrete fences shall be finished with stucco on both sides and painted in a color compatible with the principal and accessory buildings on the plot. The use of shipping containers shall not be permitted as accessory buildings on residentially-used property. Truck bodies shall be prohibited in all zoning districts as accessory buildings. Signs shall be maintained in accordance with requirements of section 39-55 of this Code.

(4) _Site plans._ All property, including buildings, structures, and grounds, shall be maintained in accordance with the approved site plan, including, but not limited to, parking and loading areas, ingress and egress, landscaping, signage, and design standards.

(f) It shall be the responsibility of any property owner and the authorized occupant of public property to maintain the premises free of any junk vehicles, items, and vessels, derelict aircraft, debris, trash, garbage, and litter, except for junk vehicles, vessels, or derelict aircraft stored within a building or other facility approved by the governmental authority having jurisdiction over such public property.

(g) Nothing shall be allowed on or in any structure, land, or water body in any district that shall in any way be offensive or obnoxious, based upon a reasonable person standard, by reason of the emission of odors, gases, dust, smoke, vibrations, or noise (including the crowing of cocks, barking of dogs, or any noises or odors emanating from any animal, fish, or fowl), taking into account the surrounding ambient conditions. Nor shall anything be constructed or maintained that would in any way constitute an eyesore to adjacent property owners or residents, or the community, based upon a reasonable person standard. Noise violations shall be determined based upon the provisions of Chapter 27, Article VII, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances and this section. An alleged violation of these provisions shall be investigated and determined by a code enforcement officer. Enforcement of alleged violations of this code shall be pursuant to Chapter 8½ of the Broward County Code of Ordinances.

The hearing officer shall be a resident of Broward County and a member in good standing with The Florida Bar engaged in the practice of law in Broward County.

(b) _Pre-taking hearings for junk vehicles, vessels, and derelict aircraft._ If a contest has been filed with the Division to any notice of violation issued pursuant to the requirements of Section 39-134, at the next available hearing, the hearing officer shall conduct a pre-taking hearing and make a determination as to whether junk property is in violation of the provisions of this article.

(c) At the informal pre-assessment hearing, the Director of the Urban Planning Division may consider the statements of the property owner and other persons with personal knowledge pertaining to the violation, and any documentation or information submitted which pertains to the violation.

(d) At the conclusion of the informal hearing, based on the amount of costs and administrative fees incurred by the County in clearing the property, and any statements and documentation presented at the informal hearing, the Director may recommend to the County Administrator the settlement, adjustment, or other compromise of the violation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) below.
