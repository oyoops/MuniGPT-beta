PREFACE

The Board of County Commissioners of Broward County herewith presents the "Code of Broward County" being a compilation of County ordinances, resolutions, administrative rules and regulations, and laws of the state, including special acts of direct application to Broward County and general laws and statutes of interest to the county officials during the codification project. Also included are certain state administrative rules and regulations which the county felt would be useful to the users of this Code. For a further analysis of the contents of this Code, the user is directed to the comparative tables, which show the source of each provision and its location in this Code. The source of each section of the Code is also set out in parentheses immediately following each section.

The Code has been republished in 2001 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 89 to the 1976 publication, and this republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code.

The inclusion of county ordinances is on the basis of the basis of the authority of their enactment as contained in Article VIII, Section 1 of the State Constitution and Laws of Florida, Chapter 69-32, which provides that counties shall maintain a current compilation of all Ordinances and shall publish them annually.

The titles of acts, ordinances and regulations, as well as stock legislative phrases such as "all laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby repealed" have been omitted.

The editors have made every attempt to leave the provisions of the Code in their original form, but for the sake of uniformity, minor editorial changes not affecting substantive provisions have been made. For example, a citation in a given provision to another section of the original law or ordinance is changed so that the citation is to a given section of this Code. Section and subsection numbers have also been changed for uniformity. Capitalization is changed so that is uniform throughout the Code. In addition, terms such as "this act," "this ordinance," etc., have been replaced with the terminology "this chapter," "this article" or "this division" inasmuch as the Code is arranged into chapters, articles and divisions.

The Code has been compiled by subject matter in chapters alphabetically arranged and numbered in that order. For the purpose of continuity and convenience of the user, as well as to facilitate indexing, each section has been codified by section numbers furnished by the editors.

The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which

may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

| Charter | CHT:1 |
| --- | --- |
| Related Laws | RL:1 |
| Charter Comparative Table | CHTCT:1 |
| Related Laws Comparative Table | RLCT:1 |
| Code | CD1:1 |
| Code Appendix | CDA:1 |
| Code Comparative Tables | CCT:1 |
| State Law Reference Table | SLT:1 |
| Charter and Related Laws Index | CHTi:1 |
| Code Index | CDi:1 |

The editors have not attempted to exercise any judicial judgment as to the repeal or amendment of laws or ordinances where doubt exists. However, those sections which have been specifically repealed, held invalid by the courts, enacted for a specified length of time and the time having expired, enacted for a specific purpose and the purpose having been accomplished, e.g., appropriations, or which have obviously been superseded by later laws or ordinances, have been omitted. Also omitted are certain laws and ordinances affecting only specific areas, and devoid of countywide significance. The catchlines of most sections, article titles and many subsection catchlines were supplied by the editors. A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding, whereby ordinances enacted as filed with the Secretary of State and all pertinent laws enacted at each succeeding session of the Legislature, will be properly edited for inclusion in the Code and the appropriate pages affected will be reprinted for distribution to the holders of the volume.

The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and Thomas B. Calhoun, editorial counselor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Especial credit must be granted the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the entire project.

The republication of the Code was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.

This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of Broward County, Florida.

(7) Notice to neighboring properties: Except as otherwise provided in this section, proof, acceptable to the Division, that written notice of the application for administrative adjustment has been provided to all contiguous property owners, including those located across the street(s) from the property subject to the application.

(3) That the general purposes of the Code, including Article VIII, will be maintained with the adjusted requirements; and

(4) That the granting of the administrative adjustment would not be injurious to the public health, safety, or welfare.

(i) _Expiration:_ Unless appealed, administrative adjustments which allow the issuance of a permit shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of rendition of such adjustment if:

(1) No zoning permit, certificate of use, or other required license has been issued based upon and incorporating the administrative adjustment; or

# Sec. 39-57. General provisions.

The following regulations apply to all signs authorized under this article:

(a) _Building Code._ The Florida Building Code shall control the construction, inspection, maintenance, and demolition of permanent signs, structures, or flag holders.

(b) _Private signs are not permitted on public property._ No private sign shall be erected, altered, or maintained over or upon any publicly owned property or right-of-way. Signs placed in violation of this provision are a violation of this article and shall be subject to immediate removal by Broward County without notice. The placement of an unlawful sign on public property is transient in nature and is, therefore, irreparable.

(c) _Sign placement._ All signs and sign structures must be erected and attached completely on or within the site or property of the owner(s) or occupant(s) installing the permanent or temporary sign. Signs and sign structures shall not extend into any applicable legal right-of-way. No sign shall be erected, altered, or maintained in such location or position as to present any unfinished side toward adjacent property. Trees, rocks, or other naturally occurring landscape features may not be used to support signs. Unless specifically provided elsewhere in this article, a building that abuts the edge of the building site or parcel may only utilize wall, building, or window signs.

(d) _Freestanding sign setbacks._ Unless otherwise provided in this article, permanent and temporary freestanding signs must be at least five (5) feet from any dedicated right-of-way or recorded road easement and must be at least three (3) feet from any other privately owned property. A freestanding sign within a nonresidentially zoned district must be at least twenty-five (25) feet from any residentially zoned property. Setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the outermost portion of the sign that is closest to the parcel line.

(e) _Legibility of signs._ To reduce the dangers of distracting motorists, signs should be adequately legible under the circumstances in which they are primarily seen. The legibility of signs is related to:

(1) The speed at which they are viewed;

(2) The context and surroundings in which they are seen; and

(3) The design, colors, and contrast of the sign copy and sign face.

(f) _Sign height calculation._

(1) The overall height of a freestanding sign or sign structure is measured from the lowest point of the ground directly below the sign to the highest point of the freestanding sign or sign structure.

(2) Exception: Where a freestanding sign or sign structure is mounted within fifty (50) feet of a roadway that has a higher grade level, as compared to the grade level directly below the freestanding sign or sign structure, then the freestanding sign or sign structure's height will be measured from the roadway grade level to the highest point of the freestanding sign or sign structure.

(g) _Sign area calculation._

(1) Unless otherwise provided herein, the sign area shall be calculated as the area within the smallest regular geometric shape or combination of shapes that encompass all the display elements (letters, numbers, figures, characters, logos, etc.) of the sign, including blank areas between display elements.

(2) Sign cabinets. The area of sign faces enclosed in frames or cabinets is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet.

(3) Double-sided signs. Only one (1) side of a double-sided sign is counted in determining the area of sign faces. Where the two (2) sides are not of equal size, the larger of the two (2) sides is used for the determination of sign area. Wedged signs shall be expressed as the sum of the areas of all the faces.

(4) Awnings and marquees. When graphics are incorporated into an awning, the sign area is determined by computing the area of a standard imaginary geometric shape around the sign copy area or graphics.

(h) _Removal prior to tropical storm or hurricane._ To avoid such signs from becoming projectiles, all permitted temporary signs and signs of a temporary nature that do not require a permit pursuant to this article must be removed by the individual that placed the sign, or the individual's designee, in the event that a tropical storm or hurricane warning has been issued for Broward County.

(i) _Failure to comply._ Failure to comply with the requirements of this article shall be deemed a County ordinance violation and the issuance of a citation or notice to appear by a code enforcement officer shall occur, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8½ of the Broward County Code of Ordinances. The process set forth in Chapter 8½ of the Broward County Code of Ordinances is supplemental to any other method of enforcement of the Code of Ordinances authorized by law.

(Ord. No. 2018-15 , § 2, 4-10-18)

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 4, 5-23-17; Ord. No. 2020-34 , §§ 1, 15, 9-22-20; Ord. No. 2022-22 , § 7, 5-11-22)

# Sec. 39-78. General provisions and design standards.

(a) Low impact site design practices, such as preserving existing native trees and vegetation, shall be used to the extent feasible. Where established native vegetation is incorporated into the landscape design, irrigation of those areas shall not be required.

(b) The plant palette and irrigation system shall be appropriate for site conditions, taking into account that, in some cases, soil improvement can enhance water use efficiency.

(c) Plants shall be grouped together by irrigation demand. The percentage of landscaped area in irrigated high water use hydrozones shall be minimized.

(d) All landscapes must be designed and planted in accordance with Florida-Friendly LandscapingTM principles. The percentage of landscaped area, excluding turfgrass areas, in irrigated high water use hydrozones shall be no more than twenty percent (20%) of the total non-turfgrass landscaped area.

(e) Site designs and landscape plans shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Florida and local laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances. All landscape irrigation system designs shall be consistent with the standards for water conservation developed pursuant to Section 373.228, Florida Statutes.

(f) The landscape plan design shall consider offsite features such as buildings, infrastructure, trees on abutting properties, or the canopy dripline that could encroach onto the subject property or be within a distance that would affect the subject property's landscape design. In all such cases, the landscape design shall take these offsite features into consideration so they will not conflict with each other, now or in the future, and will develop in harmony with the surrounding properties as the landscape normally matures.

(g) The landscape plan design shall consider proximity of proposed trees with both onsite and offsite features so that the development of tree roots will not destroy these features or infrastructure. Both canopy and the development of mature roots shall be considered when selecting tree species. Credit may be provided towards the required tree count, as described in Section 39-87(b)(2)(g), in cases where trees protrude onto the subject property.

(h) Solar panels on roofs or on the ground within the landscape area, if present or planned for the future, shall be taken into account when designing the species and tree placement of the landscaping on the subject property so as not to block sun access to the solar panels.

(i) The landscape plan design shall consider natural drainage features to minimize runoff. The use of pervious surfaces and areas is preferred; therefore, impervious surfaces and materials within the landscaped area shall be limited to borders, sidewalks, step stones, parking lots, and other similar materials, and shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the landscaped area. Use of pervious paving materials, where appropriate, is encouraged.

(j) The landscape plan design should consider the soil volume requirements for trees based on their size at maturity and their distance from any adjacent paved or hardscape areas and utility infrastructure. Larger soil volumes lead to greater tree size, better tree health, longer tree life, greater environmental benefits, and fewer costs, such as those associated with tree replacement and damage by roots to property improvements and infrastructure.

(k) For properties that are five (5) acres or less in size, reclaimed or nonpotable water should be used for irrigation if an acceptable source is determined to be available by the water provider and there is a reclaimed (reuse) water transmission line that is within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject property, as measured from the property line of the subject property. For properties larger than five (5) acres in size and that have a reclaimed (reuse) water transmission line within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject property, as measured from the property line of the subject property, reclaimed (reuse) water shall be used for irrigation of the property.

(l) Landscape design shall conform to meet Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 5, 5-23-17)

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 8, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-81. Standards for land clearing and preservation of trees and native vegetation.

(a) Ecological communities shall be preserved pursuant to Chapter 5, Article XII, Sections 5-279 through 5-286, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances. Sites shall incorporate or create an ecological community as follows:

(1) Sites of two (2) to five (5) acres in size may incorporate an ecological community into the landscape perimeter buffer or interior landscaping requirements.

(2) On sites of more than five (5) acres in size, where there is no viable ecological community, the applicant shall so indicate on the landscape plan and set aside an area or areas equivalent to two and one-half percent (2½%) of the site to be planted and preserved as an ecological community. An ecological community created on any portion of the subject property shall count towards meeting the requirements of this article.

(3) Single family and single duplex lots, independent of a larger development, shall not be subject to the ecological community or set aside requirements, but are subject to the requirements of Section 39-85 of this article. Tree preservation ordinances shall remain applicable to all development as described in Chapter 27, Article XIV, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances.

(b) Tree preservation ordinances. Notwithstanding the requirements of Chapter 27, Article XIV, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, when clearing, care should be taken to preserve as much of the native woody vegetation on the site as practicable. Vegetation that is set aside for preservation shall be protected from all onsite construction impacts. Protective barriers shall be installed along the perimeter of all preserve areas. Protective barriers shall be constructed at such intervals to prevent machinery from passing between them. No equipment or materials shall be permitted to be stored within the set aside areas, and dumping of excess soil, liquids, or any other construction debris within the preservation areas is prohibited. Removal or regrading of soils within preservation areas is prohibited. Any damaged vegetation within the set aside areas shall be replaced with vegetation equivalent to the vegetation destroyed before any certificates of occupancy or other site plan approvals may be issued.

(c) Utility facilities, easements, or rights-of-way; stormwater, drainage, and flowage easements and rights-of-way; and current and future rights-of-way identified in the County's Trafficways Plan are exempt from provisions (a) and (b) of this section. However, applications for conceptual site plan review or final site plan approval should not locate such facilities, easements, or rights-of-way within preserved ecological communities, unless impracticable, and shall not designate areas affected by such facilities, easements, or rights-of-way as a set aside area.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 9, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-82. Existing and imported soils.

(a) _Existing topsoil or imported topsoil._

(1) Where landscape plans are required, applicants are encouraged to seek a soil test and analysis, performed by a reputable soil testing lab, to determine soil texture, percentage of organic matter, measurement of pH, total soluble salts, and estimated soil infiltration rate.

(2) Existing horticulturally-suitable topsoil onsite shall be stockpiled and respread during final site grading.

(3) Any imported topsoil required shall be similar to the existing soil in pH, texture, permeability, and other characteristics, unless demonstrated to the EPGMD that a different type of soil amendment approach is justified. Further, existing or imported topsoil:

a. Shall be free of roots, clods, stones larger than three-fourths (¾) inch in the greatest dimension, pockets of coarse sand, noxious weeds, sticks, lumber, brush, and other litter. It shall not be infested with undesirable disease-causing organisms such as insects and plant pathogens; and

b. For all planting areas, shall be composed of a minimum of thirty percent (30%) muck or horticulturally-acceptable organic material.

(b) _Mechanically mixed planting soil._

(1) Mechanically mixed planting soil is typically identified as being composed of sandy loam (fifty percent (50%) coarse sand and fifty percent (50%) muck), typical of the locality, or as specified. At a minimum, mechanically mixed planting soil must meet the following requirements:

a. Gradation limits - soil shall be a sandy loam, loam, or clay loam. The definition of soil texture shall be the USDA classification scheme. Gravel over one-quarter (¼) inch in diameter shall be less than twenty percent (20%) by weight.

b. Permeability rate - hydraulic conductivity rate shall be not less than one inch (1") per hour nor more than twenty inches (20") per hour, when tested in accordance with the USDA Handbook Number 60 (Diagnosis and Improvement of Saline and Alkaline Soils), method 34b, Hydraulic Conductivity of Disturbed Soils, or other approved method.

c. Fertility - the range of the essential elemental concentration in soil shall be as specified for its intended use.

(2) The use of solid waste compost as a soil amendment is encouraged, where it is appropriate.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 7, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-83. Appropriate plant, sod, and tree selection, location, and arrangement.

(a) _General._ Plant selection should be based on the plant's adaptability to the existing conditions present at the landscaped area and native plant communities, particularly considering appropriate hardiness zone, soil type and moisture conditions, light, mature plant size, desired effect, color, and texture. Plant species that are tolerant to drought, wind, or salt are preferred. Determinations of prohibited and controlled plant species shall be pursuant to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Chapter 5B-57, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), and the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FLEPPC) Invasive Plant Species list. Plant species identified as prohibited and controlled according to Chapter 5B-57, F.A.C., and the FLEPPC Invasive Plant Species list may not be used, except as specifically allowed therein.

(1) _Plant quality grades._ Plants used to meet the requirements of this article shall conform to the standards for Florida Grade One, or better, as provided in the most current edition of Florida Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, by the Division of Plant Industry, Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, State of Florida. Sod shall be clean and visibly free of weeds, noxious pests, and diseases.

(2) _Native plant species._ Fifty percent (50%) of all vegetation, excluding turf, required to be planted by this article shall be vegetation native to South Florida, consistent with NatureScape landscape principles and Florida-Friendly LandscapingTM principles. Native and drought-tolerant landscaping shall be identified on the landscape plan in compliance with the zoning designation of the property, as indicated in Sections 39-85 and 39-87 of this article.

(3) _Invasive plants._ Prohibited and controlled plant species, pursuant to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Chapter 5B-57, FLEPPC Invasive Plant Species list, that are existing on site shall be removed.

(b) _Water requirements for plants._ Plants shall be grouped in accordance with their respective water (hydrozone) and maintenance needs consistent with Florida-Friendly LandscapingTM principles. Plants with similar water and cultural (soil, climate, sun, and light) requirements shall be grouped together (habitat). Consideration should be given to plantings that require minimal or no use of gasoline-powered maintenance equipment.

(1) The hydrozones shall be shown on the irrigation layout and planting plans, as required. Where natural conditions are such that irrigation is not required, the presence of site-appropriate plants shall not be considered a high water use hydrozone.

(2) For the purposes of the Code, hydrozones shall be grouped into the following hydrozone categories:

a. High water use hydrozone - typically annuals, grass, and sod;

b. Medium water use hydrozone - combination of a high and low water use hydrozone; and

c. Low water use hydrozone - drought tolerant plantings and most trees.

(3) The combined size of all high water use hydrozones, other than turf areas, shall be limited to twenty percent (20%) of the total landscaped area. In landscapes irrigated with reclaimed (reuse) water, the allowable size of all high water use zones shall not be limited. These high water use limits do not apply to landscaped areas requiring large amounts of turf for their primary functions.

(c) _Tree species._ Canopy trees shall be of a species having an average mature crown spread of greater than twenty (20) feet and shall have trunks that can be maintained with over six (6) feet of clear trunk. Trees or palms having an average mature crown spread of less than twenty (20) feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a twenty (20) foot crown spread. Such a grouping shall count as one (1) tree towards meeting tree requirements for any provision herein. Additional tree requirements and considerations are as follows:

(1) Tree sizes: Tree species shall have a minimum height as shown below at time of installation. Minimum canopy spread shall be characteristic of the species at such height.

a. Small trees (mature height of less than 15 feet): minimum tree size is 8 feet;

b. Medium trees (mature height of 15 feet - 25 feet): minimum tree size is 10 feet; and

c. Large trees (mature height of more than 25 feet): minimum tree size is 12 feet.

(2) Tree species diversity requirements: Based on the existing and required quantity of total trees required to meet the requirements of the Code for the subject property, the following conditions shall determine the number of differing species that will be required:

Preserved Trees + Existing Trees = Total Required Trees. Therefore, if:

a. Required trees = 6—10, then a minimum of two (2) species shall be used.

b. Required trees = 11—20, then a minimum of three (3) species shall be used.

c. Required trees = 21—50, then a minimum of four (4) species shall be used.

d. Required Trees = 51 or more, then a minimum of five (5) species shall be used.

These requirements are based on perimeter and interior requirement totals and calculations.

(3) Credit for existing native and noninvasive trees preserved on a site shall be granted towards meeting the tree requirements of any landscaping provisions of this article. No credit shall be granted for preserved trees that are in extremely poor condition or have a tree condition rating of 5.

(4) Trees used in the required landscaping adjacent to a public street or swale are subject to approval by the County so that the sustainable character, biological diversity of tree species, and safety of the public street can be maintained, the reduction of the urban heat island effect shall be encouraged, and Complete Streets and "walkable" communities shall be promoted.

(5) All large trees installed within six (6) feet of public infrastructure shall utilize a root barrier system, as approved by the County. Tree root barriers shall be installed at the sidewalk edge in those circumstances where tree roots are causing, or may potentially cause, a trip hazard because of lifting of some portions of a public sidewalk.

(6) Tree removal is to be conducted pursuant to Chapter 27, Article XIV, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances.

(d) _Palm species._ Palms shall be of a species that has an average mature crown spread of not less than fifteen (15) feet, or may be substituted with smaller palms by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a twenty (20) foot crown spread, subject to the following:

(1) Palms shall have a minimum of six (6) feet of clear trunk or greywood at installation.

(2) Palms shall constitute no more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the total tree requirements.

(e) _Shrub species._ Shrubs used as hedges shall be a minimum height of two (2) feet, full to base, and planted two (2) feet on center when measured immediately after planting. When shrubs are used as a screen around vehicular open space areas, said shrubs shall be a minimum of two (2) feet in height above the vehicular open space pavement surface that directly abuts the shrubs at time of planting and, if within a safe sight distance triangle, shall be no greater than thirty (30) inches in height, in accordance to Section 39-88 of this article. Hedges required as a buffer shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken solid visual screen, with a minimum height of three (3) feet to be attained within one (1) year after planting. Use of several native species is preferable, but not required. When seen in profile, the upper portion of the hedge shall be narrower than the lower portion.

(f) _Vine species._ Vines shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches in supported height immediately after planting, may be used in conjunction with fences, visual screens, or walls, and shall be planted at ten (10) foot intervals to meet landscape buffer requirements.

(g) _Groundcover species._ Groundcover shall be planted with a minimum of fifty percent (50%) coverage, with one hundred percent (100%) coverage occurring within six (6) months after installation.

(h) _Turf._ Turf areas shall be sodded using species suitable as permanent lawns in the County. Where appropriate, turf species that require minimum irrigation are encouraged. The type and location of turf areas shall be selected in the same manner as with all the other plantings. Irrigated turf areas, as opposed to nonirrigated turf areas, are considered to be high water use hydrozones. Irrigated turf shall not be treated as a fill-in material but rather as a planned element of the landscape. Turf shall be placed so that it can be irrigated using separate zones.

(1) Irrigated turf areas shall be consolidated and limited to those areas on the site that receive pedestrian traffic, provide for recreation use, provide cover for septic tank drainfields and required drainfield reserve areas, or provide soil erosion control, such as on slopes or in swales, and, in limited instances, where turf is used as a design unifier or other similar practical use.

(2) As a matter of public safety, no turf that requires mowing shall be allowed on slopes greater than four-to-one (4:1) or within ten (10) feet of the water's edge, except where adjacent to seawalls and bulkheads or needed to control erosion.

(3) Turf areas shall be identified on the landscape plan and be subject to the requirement that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the landscaped area for multifamily dwellings and other development uses (excluding single family residences and duplex dwellings, which are subject to the turf requirements set forth in Section 39-85 of this article) may be in turf.

(i) _Sustainable Sites._ LEED and Sustainable Sites concepts are encouraged in order to increase Green Infrastructure for sites being developed and to make them more environmentally conducive.

(1) The Sustainable Sites (SS) LEED category rewards decisions about the environment surrounding the building, with credits that emphasize the vital relationships among buildings, ecosystems, and ecosystem services. It focuses on restoring project site elements, integrating the site with local and regional ecosystems, and preserving the biodiversity relied upon by natural systems.

(2) The Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES®) is a program based on the understanding that land is a crucial component of the built environment and can be planned, designed, developed, and maintained to protect and enhance the benefits derived from healthy functioning landscapes.

# Sec. 39-84. Landscaping installation.

All landscaping shall be installed according to accepted planting procedures with the quality of plants as described in Section 39-83 of this article.

(a) Topsoil shall be of the minimum quality as specified in Section 39-82 of this article. Excluding palm trees, all trees shall be planted with twelve (12) inches of topsoil around the root ball and shrubs shall be planted with a minimum of six (6) inches of topsoil around the root ball. A minimum of three (3) inches of shredded, approved, organic mulch or groundcover shall be installed around each tree planting, including palms, for a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches beyond its trunk in all directions and throughout all hedge and shrub planting. A six (6) inch clear area will be made around each trunk to prevent root rot and other damaging effects. The use of clean mulch (i.e., seeds killed) either recycled or obtained from Melaleuca, Eucalyptus, Australian Pine, or other nonold growth hardwood is encouraged in order to reduce impacts on the environment and to preserve the remaining native plant communities.

(b) All trees and palms shall be properly guyed and/or staked at the time of planting until establishment, which should not exceed more than seven (7) months for broadleaf trees and one (1) year for palms. The use of nails, wire, rope, or any other method which damages the trees or palms is prohibited. All plants shall be installed so that the top of the root ball remains even with, or slightly above, the soil grade.

(c) No large trees which are indicated as "Category 1 Trees" in Appendix 1 of Chapter 27, Article XIV, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, shall be located closer than twelve (12) feet from streetlights. No palms shall be closer than seven (7) feet from streetlights. The spacing of trees from electric utility lines must follow those guidelines established by Florida Power and Light publication "Right Tree, Right Place," and the publication The Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Handbook, 2015, with Section #1: "Right Plant, Right Place."

(d) The soil volume around and adjacent to the tree should be adequate to allow for a healthy root zone based on the ultimate tree size at maturity.

(e) A layer of organic mulch three (3) inches deep shall be placed in plant beds, except annual beds, and individual trees in turf areas. Mulch rings should extend at least three (3) feet around freestanding trees and shrubs. Mulch should be at least six (6) inches away from any portion of a building or structure, or the trunks of trees, and at least three (3) inches away from the base of shrubs.

(f) Inspections of site for landscape installation:

(1) Prior to installation, a preinspection of the site by the County is required to determine conditions on the subject property and appropriate use and selection of landscape material.

(2) Before the landscape inspector makes the final inspection on commercial and industrial sites only, the landscape architect of record shall provide a certification letter to the County certifying that the landscaping was installed according to the plans and specifications.

(3) On commercial and industrial sites only, a final landscape inspection by the County will be required upon completion.

(g) When the landscaping has been installed and established by the contractor or installer, the owner of the property shall be subject to this article and shall be responsible for the maintenance of the land and landscaping so as to present a healthy, sustainable, vigorous, and neat appearance, free from refuse and debris.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 11, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-85. Minimum landscaping requirements for single family and duplex dwellings.

All new single family and duplex residential dwellings shall conform to the following landscaping requirements:

(a) _Landscape plans required._ Owners of detached single family and duplex residential dwellings may submit landscape plans in the form of a landscape permit application. Any such landscape plans, or a note included on the corresponding site plans if no landscape plans are submitted for a particular project, shall identify the plants selected for the site and the quantity, size, and quality of such plants (including which plants constitute Florida-Friendly LandscapingTM vegetation), and planting specifications, as required by this article. Landscape drawings are not required for single family residences and duplex dwellings.

(b) _Generalized minimum landscape and irrigation requirements._ The following table shall be used as general interpretation of the required minimum landscape and buffering standards by lot size.

(c) The Board of County Commissioners has determined that the removal and destruction of junk vehicles and vessels and derelict aircraft from private property, the removal and sale of junk vehicles, items, vessels, and derelict aircraft from airport property, and the abatement of unsecured vacant buildings, after the reasonable opportunity for a hearing, is an appropriate means of furthering the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Broward County.

(d) Farm operations located on that portion of a plot or plots of land located in agricultural, rural, and estate districts which have been classified as agricultural pursuant to Section 193.461, Florida Statutes, or the use of which has been determined to be a farm pursuant to an administrative determination of the zoning official or a final order of a hearing officer or court of law in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, which has been in existence for one (1) year or more since its established date of operation, and which was not a nuisance at the time of its established date of operation, shall constitute a public or private nuisance if the farm operation does not conform to generally accepted agricultural and management practices or if it is determined by the code enforcement hearing officer that any of the following conditions exist:

(f) The expansion of a farm operation will not be permitted to a more excessive farm operation with regard to noise, odor, dust, or fumes where the existing farm operation is adjacent to an established homestead or business on March 15, 1982.

(b) _Pre-taking hearings for junk vehicles, vessels, and derelict aircraft._ If a contest has been filed with the Division to any notice of violation issued pursuant to the requirements of Section 39-134, at the next available hearing, the hearing officer shall conduct a pre-taking hearing and make a determination as to whether junk property is in violation of the provisions of this article. The hearing officer shall receive evidence and testimony from the person(s) contesting the charge, if present, or such person's(s') authorized representative; from anyone claiming an interest in the junk property; from any witness(es) the owner(s) of the junk property wishes to present; from any witness(es) presented by Broward County; and from those members of the public the hearing officer determines have relevant evidence or testimony. Hearsay evidence shall be admissible to support other testimony but shall not be sufficient alone to support a finding. Sworn testimony shall be given greater weight than unsworn testimony. Following a hearing, the hearing officer shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law determining whether the junk property cited with a notice of violation is in violation of the provisions of this article. In addition, the hearing officer shall prescribe a date by which the junk property must be removed or properly stored by the property owner.

(c) Any person who intends to appeal a decision of the hearing officer relating to a junk property shall file a notice with the Director of the Division no later than two (2) business days prior to the date set by the hearing officer for removal of the junk property. Such notice shall advise the Division that an appeal will be filed and that the junk property should not be removed. If such notice is received, the Division shall not authorize the removal of such junk property until a determination is made whether an appeal has been filed in a timely manner. If an appeal has not been filed within the time prescribed, the junk property may be removed immediately, or following the date set by the hearing officer for removal, whichever is later. If an appeal has been filed, the junk property shall not be removed until after the appeal is decided unless removal is authorized by the court.

(d) Any appeal to the final decision of the hearing officer shall be to the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit within thirty (30) days after rendition of the decision, as provided by the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Any moneys remaining after recovery of Broward County's costs shall, unless another use is required by federal law, be deposited in the state school fund. If the moneys realized from the sale of the item are insufficient to reimburse Broward County for its costs of storage, transportation, and publication of notice, the last registered owner of the boat, motor vehicle or aircraft shall be responsible for the costs.

(c) Broward County shall send notice by mail to the responsible party specifying the costs of removal, administrative costs, including the cost of prosecution, and requesting payment within thirty (30) days after the mailing of the notice. If payment is not made, Broward County may assess the actual costs of removal, including administrative fees, as a lien against the real and personal property of the responsible party and may also seek recovery of its costs by appropriate civil action or as provided by law.

(a) If any owner whose property has been cleared by Broward County fails to pay the bill sent pursuant to Section 39-135(a) within thirty (30) days after the mailing, the Board of County Commissioners may, by resolution, levy a lien on behalf of Broward County against the property for costs of clearance, together with interest thereon from the date such costs became due at the maximum rate allowed by law, plus all costs related to assessment and recording of the lien as provided by resolution of the Board. The Board may levy the total costs incurred or any mitigated or reduced amount recommended by the Director of the Urban Planning Division, or the Director's designee, at the conclusion of the pre-assessment hearing specified in subsection (c) or may levy any amount less than the total costs which the Board finds appropriate and equitable.

Evidence that notice has been mailed as provided in this section, together with proof of publication, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this section have been met, without regard to whether or not the property owner actually received such notice.

Both notices shall contain the following:

(1) A statement that, prior to the date set for the hearing before the Board of County Commissioners, the property owner or his, her, or its authorized representative (hereinafter collectively referred to as "property owner") may contest any of the costs, fees, or expenses described in the notice at an informal hearing before the Urban Planning Division;

(6) A statement that the property owner shall have the right to appear at the hearing before the Board of County Commissioners to discuss the violation regardless of whether or not the property owner requests or participates in an informal hearing procedure.

(c) At the informal pre-assessment hearing, the Director of the Urban Planning Division may consider the statements of the property owner and other persons with personal knowledge pertaining to the violation, and any documentation or information submitted which pertains to the violation.

(d) At the conclusion of the informal hearing, based on the amount of costs and administrative fees incurred by the County in clearing the property, and any statements and documentation presented at the informal hearing, the Director may recommend to the County Administrator the settlement, adjustment, or other compromise of the violation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) below.

(e) Nothing contained herein shall prohibit Broward County from seeking recovery of its costs by appropriate civil action or as provided by law.

(f) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Broward County Code of Ordinances and the Broward County Administrative Code to the contrary, any powers conferred upon the Board of County Commissioners to execute satisfactions and releases or otherwise settle or mitigate land clearance liens pursuant to this article is hereby delegated to the County Administrator.

Where an alcoholic beverage establishment is located in conformity with the provisions of this article, the subsequent locating of a place of worship, educational center or child care center within one thousand (1,000) lineal feet of the existing alcoholic beverage establishment shall not be construed to cause such establishment to be in violation of this article or to be considered a non-conforming use.

Further, it is recognized that the location of even one such use near a residential area of other incompatible use causes such deleterious effects on the neighborhood and on the businesses that serve the neighborhood. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting and downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood.

(Ord. No. 1999-44, § 9, 8-24-99)

# Sec. 39-200. Distance limitations for adult entertainment establishments.

(a) No adult entertainment establishment shall be located or operated nearer to any other adult entertainment establishment nor nearer than one thousand (1,000) feet to any place of worship, child care center or educational center, except vocational and technical schools, colleges and universities.

### ARTICLE XVII. COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS

# Sec. 39-292. Commercial zoning districts.

The following shall constitute commercial zoning districts for the purposes of this Code:

B-1 Limited Commercial Business District

B-2 General Commercial Business District

B-3 Intense Commercial Business District

B-4 Commercial Redevelopment Overlay Districts

C-1 Commercial Warehouse District

CR Commercial Recreation District

OP Office Park District

(Ord. No. 1999-23, § 3, 5-11-99; Ord. No. 2000-14, § 1, 4-11-00)

# Sec. 39-293. Purpose of districts.

(a) The B-1 Limited Commercial Business District is intended to meet the personal service needs of the local neighborhood. Such districts are primarily located on a local collector road, contiguous to residentially-zoned properties, rather than a major thoroughfare. All activities of permitted uses are limited to the interior of a building, except as specifically permitted in section 39-300, "Limitations of uses."

(b) The B-2 General Commercial Business District is intended to meet the shopping and service needs of several residential neighborhoods or a substantial residential area. B-2 districts are primarily located on a major thoroughfare or arterial catering to vehicular traffic. All activities of permitted uses are limited to the interior of a building, except as specifically permitted in section 39-300, "Limitations of uses."

(c) The B-3 Intense Commercial Business District is intended primarily to accommodate establishments and services catering to the business and industrial community and for services not used by residents on a regular basis. Such districts are not appropriate for locations which are contiguous to residential properties. Due to the size of permissible items which may be sold or maintained, display and storage are permitted outside.

(d) The B-4 Commercial Redevelopment Overlay Districts are intended to provide incentives for redevelopment of older, commercial areas which have experienced a decline in occupancy, maintenance and economic viability.

(e) The C-1 Commercial Warehouse District is intended for certain repair and maintenance services, wholesale, storage and warehouse uses, and sales or rental of large or heavy machinery and equipment. Such districts serve a regional clientele or nearby industrial areas and do not cater to residential areas or pedestrian traffic.

(f) The CR Commercial Recreation District is intended to accommodate major public and private commercial recreation facilities which offer opportunities to residents and tourists.

(g) The OP Office Park District is intended to encourage the location of planned office complexes and corporate headquarters in a campus-like atmosphere with substantial buildings and ample open space, including limited services for employees such as shopping and food service establishments.

(Ord. No. 1999-23, § 3, 5-11-99; Ord. No. 2000-14, § 2, 4-11-00)

# Sec. 39-294. General provisions.

(a) _Alcoholic Beverage Establishments._ Any establishment selling or dispensing alcoholic beverages or allowing on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages must comply with all requirements of Article XI of this Chapter, "Alcoholic Beverage and Adult Entertainment Establishments."

(b) _Display of products for sale_. In B-1, B-2, B-4, RO, and OP districts, all products displayed for sale shall be located within a building, except that produce, plants, and lawn and garden equipment may be displayed and stored outside in an area designated on an approved site plan, provided the display and storage area is located at least fifty (50) feet from any residentially-zoned plot and is not within any required landscape buffer. Such outside display areas shall be enclosed with a fence at least six (6) feet in height. At least one (1) side of the display and storage area shall be contiguous to the principal building to which it is accessory. Stocking of the produce or plants or pick-up by customers shall be done internally or through a single gate at the designated offstreet loading area.

(c) _Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures_. Dumpsters located on any property in a commercial zoning district shall comply with the following:

(1) Dumpsters shall be kept within opaque or translucent enclosures and shall be located at least five (5) feet inside any plot line; however, no dumpster or dumpster enclosure shall be located in a required setback or buffer area, unless a street or dedicated alley separates the commercial plot from any adjacent residential property.

(2) Dumpsters shall be maintained free of jagged or sharp edges or inside parts which could prevent the free discharge of their contents.

(3) Dumpsters shall be emptied by a licensed collector at intervals which will preclude overflow. Dumpsters and the area around the dumpster and dumpster enclosure shall not be used for disposal of furniture and major appliances and shall be maintained by the property owner free of overflowing refuse at all times. If a continuous problem of insufficient dumpster capacity is proven to exist, additional or larger capacity dumpsters and enclosures or increased frequency of pick-up shall be required in order to eliminate the overflow problem.

(4) All dumpster pads shall be at least two (2) feet larger than the dumpster on all sides. Wheel stops or posts shall be permanently affixed to the pad at least one foot inside the perimeter of the pad to prevent the dumpster from striking the enclosure during collection.

(5) Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures shall be located in a position accessible for collection by the equipment of the collector.

(6) The dumpster enclosure shall be constructed so as to accommodate recycling bins, if the recycling bins are over forty (40) gallons.

(7) The gates of the enclosure shall be constructed of a frame with opaque or translucent walls affixed thereto, and both frame and walls shall be of a material of sufficient strength to withstand normal use. Gates shall be attached to metal posts at least three (3) inches in diameter with at least two (2) hinges. Each gate shall have a wheel at the bottom to prevent sagging and shall have drop pins or rods to hold the gates in place in both open and closed positions.

(8) The base of the enclosure must be poured concrete, in accordance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code. The base shall extend three (3) feet beyond the front opening of the enclosure as an apron, and all concrete must be level with the adjacent surface.

(d) _Landscaping._ All buildings and uses shall provide landscaping in accordance with Article VIII of this chapter, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity."

(e) _Offstreet parking._ All buildings and uses shall provide offstreet parking, loading areas and lighting in accordance with Article XII of this Chapter, "Offstreet Parking and Loading," except as provided for B-4 Commercial Redevelopment Overlay Districts.

(f) _Setbacks and buffers between commercial business and residential districts._

(1) Except for CR Commercial Recreation districts, the minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, in any commercial zoning district which is contiguous to a residentially-zoned plot in separate ownership, shall be twenty-five (25) feet from such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. A landscape buffer as required by Article VIII, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity," shall be provided within the setback area, including a visual barrier in the form of a fence, wall, or hedge a minimum of six (6) feet in height, constructed or planted and maintained as provided in Subsection (7) following.

(2) Except for CR Commercial Recreation districts, the minimum setback for the construction or erection of any building or structure, except fences and walls, in any commercial zoning district which is separated from a residentially-zoned plot by a street, dedicated alley, canal, water area, railroad right-of-way, or public open space, shall be ten (10) feet from any such plot line, unless a greater setback is required for a specific use in this article. The entire setback area shall be a landscape buffer as required by Article VIII of this chapter, "Landscaping for Protection of Water Quality and Quantity," crossed only by pedestrian walkways and driveways necessary for ingress and egress to and from the plot.

(3) No building or structure, except fences and walls, shall be erected or maintained in any CR Commercial Recreation district closer than one hundred (100) feet from any plot line.

(4) No building or structure shall be erected or maintained within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersection of two streets, nor within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of any driveway and street, except as permitted in subsection (7) following.

(5) The setback areas in OP Office Park districts shall be double the sizes specified in subsections (1) and (2) above.

(6) The setbacks required by this section shall also apply to those unincorporated lands which abut a municipal jurisdiction. Such setbacks shall be applied in the same manner as if the municipal lands were unincorporated lands.

(7) Fences, walls and hedges may be erected or planted and maintained within the setback to a maximum height of eight (8) feet, except in vehicular use areas. Fences and walls shall be translucent. Hedges used as a required visual barrier shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height at time of planting and shall be of a species which will reach a height of at least six (6) feet within two years after planting. Open-weave or chain link fences may only be used if appropriate landscape material, in accordance with Article VIII, is planted along such fence, which, after planting, will obscure the fence and provide a translucent barrier within one year after planting. Within twenty-five (25) feet of the intersection of two streets or within fifteen (15) feet of the intersection of a private accessway and a street no fencing may be erected or maintained. The use of barbed wire, razor wire or electrified fencing shall be prohibited.

(g) _Signs._ All buildings and uses shall be subject to provisions in Article VI, of this Chapter, "Signs," except as specified in Section 39-301(d)(5) of this article.

(h) _Use of residentially-zoned property for access._ No privately owned land or public or private street that directly abuts the front yards of residentially-zoned properties shall be used for driveway or vehicular access purposes to any plot in a commercial district, except where a public street provides the sole access to the commercial property.

(i) _Use of premises without buildings._ All permitted uses shall be conducted from a building on the plot which building shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) square feet in floor area and which shall contain permanent sanitary facilities.

(j) _Definitions._ Terms used herein are defined in Article II, "Definitions," of this Chapter.

(k) _Nonconforming uses and structures._ Nonconforming uses and structures in commercial business districts shall be subject to Article VII, "Nonconforming Uses and Structures," of this Chapter.

(l) _Property maintenance._ Buildings and properties in commercial business districts shall be maintained in accordance with Article X, "Property Maintenance and Junk and Abandoned Property," of this Chapter.

(m) _Miscellaneous provisions._ In addition to general provisions herein, commercial business districts shall also be subject to Article IX, "General Provisions," of this Chapter.

(n) _Design standards._

(1) _General purpose and intent._ Commercial districts are predominantly located along major roadways with high-traffic volumes and visibility. The corridors serve as gateways to the residential neighborhoods and largely establish a community's image. Broward County recognizes it has a responsibility to provide a safe and desirable public realm and that the success of both the residential and commercial districts is related to the provision of high-quality urban design. The intent of the design standards is to regulate the design of individual buildings and structures. The design standards are further intended to synchronize with redevelopment projects. Implementation of the design standards implementation is not intended to have the effect of precluding the redevelopment, reuse, or repurposing of existing buildings and structures through strict application.

(2) _Applicability._ With the exception of properties zoned C-1, Commercial Warehouse District, or CR, Commercial Recreation District, the design standards shall apply to all properties zoned Commercial pursuant to Chapter 39, Article XVII, of the Code, as set forth herein:

a. All new construction of buildings, structures, and additions for which a development permit is obtained after February 26, 2018, shall fully comply with the design standards of this Section 39-294;

b. Except as provided in Subsection e. below, the design standards shall not apply to façade improvement projects that do not affect the rest of the site, and such projects shall not require site plan approval per the Broward County Code of Ordinances;

c. The design standards shall not apply to signs that are regulated by Chapter 39, Article VI, of the Zoning Code;

d. Where additions to an existing building or structure result in an increase of fifty (50) percent or more of the existing floor area, or improvements to the existing building or structure result in an increase of fifty (50) percent or more of the appraised value of the existing building or structure, as determined by the Broward County Property Appraiser, the existing building or structure and the addition(s) shall fully comply with the design standards; and

e. Where the improvements to a building or structure only involve façade improvements, result in an increase of less than fifty (50) percent of the appraised value of the existing building or structure, as determined by the Broward County Property Appraiser, or where additions to a building or structure result in an increase of floor area of less than fifty (50) percent of the existing floor area, the property owner shall comply with the design standards as much as reasonably possible to increase the level of conformity, as determined by the Director or designee. To enable this determination, the property owner shall submit a proposed design plan for consideration by the Director or designee that demonstrates the following:

1. That the design plan generally conforms with the purpose and intent of the design standards;

2. That each variation from the design standards is necessitated by an existing condition;

3. That each variation from the design standards is in the minimum amount reasonably necessary to address the existing condition; and

4. That there are unique and special circumstances or conditions applicable to the property in question, or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties in the same district.

(3) _Administrative Amendment._ The Urban Planning Division Director, or designee, may approve adjustments to colors that are consistent with the approved design.

(4) _Definitions._

a. _Accent color_ shall mean the color used on wall signs, awnings, and doors.

b. _Banding_ shall mean horizontal subdivisions of a wall accomplished through a change in profile or a change in materials.

c. _Base color_ shall mean the color used on the majority of a building's vertical surface.

d. _Building elements_ shall mean parts of a building such as walls, bandings, cornices, moldings, parapets, windows, awnings, canopies, roofs, doorjambs, frames, sills, shutters, or fasciae.

e. _Cornice_ shall mean a horizontal decorative molding that crowns a building, door, or window.

f. _Material_ shall mean the composition of building elements such as metal, brick, stone, wood, and concrete.

g. _Molding_ shall mean a decorative raised surface along the edge of an architectural feature such as a wall, door, window, or column.

h. _Parapet_ shall mean a low wall or barrier at the edge of the roof.

![](RackMultipart20230502-1-qkypyp_html_7a4ff669d973728d.png)

i. _Texture_ shall mean the surface characteristics, grains, and patterns of a material, such as striped, blocked, pebbled, brushed, or smooth.

j. _Transom light_ shall mean a flat glass panel above a door, usually multipaned.

k. _Trim color_ shall mean the color used on windows or doorjambs, frames, sills, shutters, or fasciae.

(5) _Visual interest._ To avoid monotony of design, front and street side exterior walls consisting of a single undifferentiated plane with a single color or texture are prohibited. Differentiation may be achieved by using a combination of ornamentation, pattern, and composition as listed below:

| Type | Minimum Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Ornamentation and form | At least one (1) of the following:
  a. Building and door cornices; or
  b. Building cornices and door and window awnings or canopies; and
 At least one (1) of the following:
  a. Trim and sill work; or
  b. Columns and banding. |
| Colors | a. Buildings shall have one (1) base and one (1) trim color.
 b. One (1) additional accent color is permitted but not required. |
| Materials and textures | Buildings shall have at least two (2) materials or textures. |

(6) _Roofs._ For new construction, including new buildings and new additions, flat roofs shall be designed with parapets at least forty-two (42) inches high on all façades.

(7) _Windows, doors, and entrances._

a. At least one (1) entrance door of each building shall face the arterial or collector roadway and be emphasized through features such as moldings, arches, transom lights, sidelights, or tilework.

b. Entrances from the sidewalk shall be inset to allow doors to open without encroaching upon the sidewalk. The Zoning official may waive this requirement where an existing building is being renovated and the requirement is deemed infeasible, based on the design of the existing building.

c. Blank or windowless elevations that face public streets are prohibited. Walls that do not include window glazing or storefront entrances shall be articulated by the provision of faux windows trimmed with frames, sills, lintels, awnings, murals, or similar elements.

d. First floor windows shall consist of clear glass and shall occupy at least forty percent (40%) of the first floor front and street-side elevations that face public streets. Glass shall be a minimum of eighteen (18) inches above the sidewalk.

(8) _Outdoor equipment._ Except for rooftop photovoltaic solar systems installed in accordance with Section 39-109 of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, all heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical, mechanical, and similar equipment shall be completely screened from view or isolated so as to not be visible from any adjacent public right-of-way or residential zoning district. Any screening shall be designed to maintain a uniform appearance with the rest of the building.

(9) _Prohibitions._ Neon tubing as well as neon, fluorescent, iridescent, metallic, and similar colors in paint, fabric, and other materials are prohibited.

(o) _Setback Waiver._ Required setback distances set forth herein shall be waived by ten percent (10%) up to a maximum of one (1) foot for any existing and completed commercial building or structure that exists prior to February 26, 2018.

# Sec. 39-295. Permitted uses.

Permitted principal uses in all business districts shall be limited to those uses specified in the Master Business List. Any use not specifically listed herein, but that is commercial in nature, shall be determined by the zoning official to be permitted in the zoning district specifying the most similar use thereto. All permitted uses shall be subject to Section 39-300, "Limitations of uses." Specific section references are included in the following Master Business List:

2. An area within a building where bicycles can be constantly observed;

3. A bicycle storage locker; or

4. Check-in parking systems where the bicycle is left with an attendant.

c. Bicycle parking facilities shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards:

1. Bicycle parking areas shall be clearly labeled as available for bicycle parking and shall not be hidden from view of the public.

2. If a room or bicycle storage locker is not divided into individual spaces or rack space, one bicycle parking space shall consist of an area not less than twelve (12) square feet with locking devices.

3. Parallel bicycle parking spaces shall provide an adjacent access aisle of four (4) feet in width. Head-in bicycle parking spaces shall provide a back-out aisle of six (6) feet in width.

(2) The amount of pervious area required by the Broward County Land Development Code may be reduced to twenty percent (20%) without the need to supplement required landscaping.

(3) The location of required accessory structures such as dumpster enclosures, buffer fences, sign structures, etc. may encroach into any required yard or buffer to accomplish the redevelopment project, provided no hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic is created.

(4) Fees related to applications for development orders, as provided in the Broward County Land Development Code, and permits shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%) and such applications shall be given a review priority over other similar projects not in a B-4 district.

(5) Staff of the various divisions of Broward County may provide assistance to the property owner in locating sources for financing, architectural and engineering services.

(e) _Redevelopment requirements._ Development permits issued pursuant to the development incentives set forth in Section (d) shall be subject to the limitations on permitted uses in the B-4 district, as set forth below:

(1) The development or redevelopment shall be subject to compliance with the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED).

(1) Dumpsters, which are visible from any street or from contiguous property, shall be kept within opaque or translucent enclosures and shall be located at least five (5) feet inside any plot line, except that no dumpster or dumpster enclosure shall be located in a required setback area, unless a street or dedicated alley separates the industrial plot from any adjacent residential or commercial business zoned property.

(2) Dumpsters shall be maintained free of jagged or sharp edges or inside parts which could prevent the free discharge of their contents.

(3) Dumpsters shall be emptied by a licensed collector at intervals which will preclude overflow. Dumpsters and the area around the dumpster and dumpster enclosure shall not be used for disposal of furniture and major appliances and shall be maintained by the property owner free of overflowing refuse at all times. If a continuous problem of insufficient dumpster capacity is proven to exist, additional or larger capacity dumpsters and enclosures or increased frequency of pick-up shall be required in order to eliminate the overflow problem.

(4) All dumpster pads shall be at least two (2) feet larger than the dumpster on all sides. Wheel stops or posts shall be permanently affixed to the pad at least one (1) foot inside the perimeter of the pad to prevent the dumpster from striking the enclosure during collection.

(5) Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures shall be located in a position accessible for collection by the equipment of the collector.

(6) The dumpster enclosure shall be constructed so as to accommodate recycling bins, if over forty (40) gallons.

(7) The gates of the enclosure shall be constructed of a frame with opaque or translucent walls affixed thereto, and both frame and walls shall be of a material of sufficient strength to withstand normal use.

# Sec. 39-404. Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this article is to establish a consistent minimum elevation for tidal flood barriers that will:

(a) Provide a standard for flood mitigation infrastructure that serves as a barrier to tidal flooding, not seepage, by accounting for water levels predicted under combined conditions of sea level rise, high tides, and high frequency storm surge through the year 2070; and

(b) Ensure new shoreline structures and major shoreline improvements are designed for use as tidal flood barriers through application of consistent standards that account for future predicted tidal flood conditions and coastal water levels associated with sea level rise in accordance with current regional sea level rise projections, as updated and adopted by the Broward County Board of County Commissioners.

( Ord. No. 2020-11 , § 1, 3-31-20)

# Sec. 39-405. Applicability.

This article applies to all new tidal flood barriers, substantial repair or substantial rehabilitation to shorelines and shoreline structures, and the installation of any fixed infrastructure attached to tidal flood barriers (such as mooring structures). This article is not applicable to oceanfront beaches or shorelines seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line.

( Ord. No. 2020-11 , § 1, 3-31-20)

# Sec. 39-406. Definitions.

For the purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivation shall have the meanings given herein, except when the context clearly indicates a different meaning.

_Berm_ means an earthen mound designed with impermeability to resist the flow of tidal waters through it to an adjacent property or public right-of-way.

_Green-grey infrastructure_ or _green-grey materials_ means a combination of engineered and natural features that provide environmental qualities and ecosystem value.

_Mooring structure_ means a boat dock, slip, davit, hoist, lift, floating vessel platform, mooring pile, or similar structure attached to land or to a seawall, to which a vessel can be moored.

_North American Vertical Datum (NAVD88)_ means the vertical control for datum of orthometric height established for vertical control surveying in the United States of America based upon the General Adjustment of the North American Datum of 1988.

_Public nuisance_ means a condition injurious to the public health or safety of the community or neighborhood, or injurious to any considerable number of persons, or a condition that obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any public right-of-way.

_Rip-rap_ means a foundation of unconsolidated boulders, stone, rubble, concrete without protruding rebar, or similar materials placed on or near a shoreline to mitigate wave impacts and prevent erosion.

_Seawall_ means a vertical or near vertical (often interlocking) structure placed between an upland area and a waterway or waterbody for erosion control.

_Seawall cap_ means a concrete box structure (usually reinforced) that connects seawall panels, piles, and anchoring system (if present) together at the top.

# Sec. 39-407. Minimum elevations for coastal infrastructure within tidally influenced areas.

(a) All new or substantially repaired or substantially rehabilitated banks, berms, green-grey infrastructure, seawalls, seawall caps, upland stem walls, or other similar infrastructure shall be designed and constructed to perform as tidal flood barriers. Tidal flood barriers shall have a minimum elevation of five (5) feet NAVD88. Applications for new or substantially repaired or substantially rehabilitated tidal flood barriers submitted prior to January 1, 2035, may be permitted a minimum elevation of four (4) feet NAVD88, if designed and constructed to accommodate a minimum elevation of five (5) feet NAVD88 by January 1, 2050.

(b) All property owners must maintain a tidal flood barrier in good repair. A tidal flood barrier is presumed to be in disrepair if it allows tidal waters to flow unimpeded through or over the barrier and onto adjacent property or public right-of-way. Failure to maintain a tidal flood barrier in good repair shall be a citable offense. The owner of the tidal flood barrier shall demonstrate progress towards repairing the cited defect within sixty (60) days after receiving a citation and shall complete repairs within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after receipt of the citation. If the required repair or rehabilitation meets the substantial repair or substantial rehabilitation threshold, no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days after receipt of the citation, the property owner shall design, obtain permits, cause to be constructed, and obtain final inspection approval of seawall improvements that meet the minimum elevation and design requirements.

(c) Tidal flood barriers below a minimum five (5) feet NAVD88 elevation shall be improved, designed, and constructed so as to prevent tidal waters from impacting adjacent property or public right-of-way. Causing, suffering, or allowing the trespass of tidal waters onto adjacent property or public right-of-way is hereby declared a public nuisance and a citable offense requiring abatement. The owner shall demonstrate progress toward addressing the cited concern within sixty (60) days after receipt of the citation and complete the construction of an approved remedy no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days after receipt of the citation.

(d) Tidal flood barriers shall be designed and constructed to prevent tidal waters from flowing through the barrier, while still allowing for the release of upland hydrostatic pressure.

(e) To the extent practicable, tidal flood barriers shall be designed and constructed to adjoin immediately proximate tidal flood barriers to close gaps and prevent trespass of tidal water.

(f) All tidal flood barriers undergoing substantial repair or substantial rehabilitation shall be constructed along the property's entire shoreline.

(g) All tidal flood barriers shall be constructed with natural limerock rip-rap, or other approved habitat enhancement, at the waterward face of the structure.

(h) Property owners are encouraged to consider approaches and materials that enhance the biological value of traditional (flat surface) seawalls and flood barriers with the incorporation of living shoreline features, use of hybrid green-grey materials, and the use of biological forms, where practicable.

(i) This section shall not be construed to require the installation of a seawall where other flood protection measures serve as an equally effective tidal flood barrier.

(j) Tidal flood barriers capable of automatically being elevated in advance of high tides to prevent tidal flooding are permissible, provided that automation cannot require daily human intervention.

# Sec. 39-412. Courtesy conceptual site plan meeting.

(a) Depending on the location, design, size, impact, or other factor of a proposed development, the Urban Planning Division Director may require an applicant to file an application for Conceptual Review of the site plan prior to filing a site plan application. The Conceptual Review is not a replacement for the full site plan application review procedure and does not qualify as a preapplication meeting.

(1) Review for completeness of a Conceptual Review application shall not be required as the review is merely conceptual. However, insufficient information may result in additional requests.

(2) When applicable, the Director shall forward the application for Conceptual Review consistent with Section 39-413(a)(3).

(3) The Urban Planning Division shall schedule a meeting with the applicant and the selected review agencies to discuss the conceptual site plans.

(4) When not required, an applicant has the option to file an application for Conceptual Review of the site plan prior to requesting a preapplication consultation.

(b) No formal comments, interpretation of the Code, or order shall be issued in conjunction with a Conceptual Review application.

( Ord. No. 2022-22 , § 17, 5-11-22)

# Sec. 39-413. Site plan review procedures.

(a) _Application Procedure._ The following procedures shall govern the review of applications:

(1) _Preapplication Required._ Prior to the filing of a site plan application, the applicant shall attend a preapplication meeting with the Urban Planning Division staff to discuss filing requirements, including the submission requirements in Table 1 above, municipal and neighborhood notification procedures, application fee, sign posting procedures, and any other issues that may affect the application. A site plan application shall not be accepted or deemed complete until this meeting has occurred.

(2) _Completeness of application._ The Urban Planning Division shall review the application to determine the completeness of required submittals based on Table 1 above. Within seven (7) days after receipt, the Urban Planning Division shall either:

a. Find that the application is complete and initiate the review process commencing on the eighth (8th) day after filing; or

b. Reject the application and forward to the applicant with a notice of incompleteness specifying the information missing from the application. The applicant shall resubmit the application with the information required within ten (10) days after the transmittal of the notice of incompleteness, or the application shall be deemed withdrawn. The Urban Planning Division shall review the resubmitted application in the manner provided in this section for the original application.

(3) _Agency Review._

a. The Director shall determine to which agencies the application shall be routed based upon the type of application submitted, the intensity/density of the proposed development, and whether the application is relevant to that reviewing agency. Each agency shall review the plan in accordance with its applicable laws, rules, and procedures. The reviewing agencies are as follows:

1. School Board of Broward County, Florida;

2. Building Code Division;

3. Parks and Recreation Division;

4. Aviation Department;

5. Broward Sheriff's Office Fire Marshal's Bureau;

6. Broward County Health Department (BCHD);

7. Water and Wastewater Services;

8. Urban Planning Division;

9. Consumer Protection Division;

10. Environmental Resources Division;

11. Environmental Permitting Division;

12. Broward County Transportation Department;

13. Traffic Engineering Division;

14. Highway Construction and Engineering Division; and

15. Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), for applications where the property abuts a trafficway that is functionally classified as a state road, and propose direct vehicle access to a state road.

b. The Director may waive agency review, in whole or in part, under this section upon a determination that such a review has already been made regarding the same land and no change in circumstances has occurred that necessitates further review, or upon a determination by the Director that further review is not necessary.

c. Additional matters to be addressed with an application for site plan:

1. The Broward County Health Department (BCHD) assesses availability of facilities by applying a gallons-per-day design flow demand rate to the proposed development and then determining whether the proposed development's demand will exceed the licensed capacity of the treatment plant, considering the existing utilized and "committed" capacity. The BCHD uses potable water design flow rates set forth in the Water Management Element of the Broward County Comprehensive Plan to assess adequacy of service at the time of site plan application for those properties that are not required to be platted. If the proposed land use does not have a potable water demand rate set forth in the Water Management Element, the BCHD is authorized to assign the most suitable rate.

2. Site plan applications involving residential uses shall be forwarded to the School Board of Broward County, Florida, for a determination as to whether the project is exempt from the requirements of public school concurrency, consistent with Chapter 5 of Broward County's Land Development Code, and the Public School Facilities Interlocal Agreement.

3. If a site plan application includes all or any part of any lands identified as a site recommended for inclusion in the Urban Wilderness Inventory by the Urban Wilderness Advisory Board pursuant to Chapter 25½ of the Code, which recommendation has been approved by the County Commission; or a site designated as a Native Vegetative Communities Category Local Area of Particular Concern within the Broward County Land Use Plan; or subject to notice of a public hearing regarding designation as a Native Vegetative Communities Category Local Area of Particular Concern or inclusion in the Urban Wilderness Inventory, which is mailed any time before a site plan application is filed, then the Urban Planning Division Director shall provide for the preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) consistent with Section 5-182.8 of the Land Development Code.

4. If the Broward County Aviation Department determines that the site plan application includes property that is or may be subject to the notice requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, Subpart B, the applicant must obtain and submit an FAA determination that it does not constitute a hazard to air navigation or require operational modifications to the airport to avoid such a hazard.

(4) _Municipal Notification._ Upon acceptance of a site plan application for public or regional facilities, such as highway rest stations, transit infrastructure, landfills, government facilities, or similar uses, a copy of the application, including all attachments and drawings, shall be forwarded by the Urban Planning Division Director, electronically or by hard copy, to any municipality within a four (4) mile radius of a boundary of the site plan and to any unincorporated area neighborhood/civic organizations within a one (1) mile radius of the site plan boundary, as listed on the "Neighborhood Association/Civic Representatives List for the Broward Municipal Services District" and as delineated on the "Broward Municipal Services District Map." Municipalities and neighborhood/civic organizations shall have the same time limits as reviewing agencies to provide written comments to the Director, as specified in Section 39-413(b). Comments received from municipalities and neighborhood/civic organizations shall be attached to the compilation of comments forwarded to the applicant in accordance with Section 39-413(b) and shall be considered by the Urban Planning Division Director only as they relate to compliance with the Code.

(5) _Posted Notice._ Notice of submittal of a site plan application must be provided by the applicant by posting, in accordance with this section. The applicant must securely post the sign(s) on the property in a visible location on each street frontage and shall submit to the Urban Planning Division an affidavit, including date-stamped photographic proof, of posting of the sign(s) in accordance with this section. If the applicant fails to submit the affidavit, processing of the application shall cease and any required action by the Director shall be postponed until such affidavit is received. The following requirements must be followed by the applicant for signage posting:

**Public Notification Signage Posting for Site Plan Approval**

| Number of signs | One (1) at the center of each property line of the project site that fronts on a public roadway. |
| --- | --- |
| Signage size requirements | No less than three (3) feet wide by two (2) feet high, with white background and black letters, and Arial font size no less than three (3) inches in height per letter. |
| Sign Update | Posted sign shall be updated by the applicant in the event the application is scheduled for quasi-judicial hearing. The update shall reflect the date, time, and location of the quasi-judicial hearing. |
| Removal, if administrative | Posted sign shall be removed within five (5) business days after issuance of agency administrative approval(s). |
| Removal, if referred to County Commission | Posted sign shall be removed within five (5) business days after final disposition of the application by the County Commission. |

\*If the applicant fails to remove the sign(s) within the time frames above, the County shall have the right to remove the sign(s).

(6) _Public Participation Plan._ For site plans located within an enclave identified within the BMSD Land Use Plan, that consist of four (4) or more residential units, new commercial, mixed use, and industrial uses shall include a plan for citizen participation. Commercial and industrial renovations or changes of use requiring a site plan that increase required parking by less than five (5) spaces or less than fifty percent (50%), whichever is greater, are exempt from this provision. A citizen participation plan must be approved by the Director, or designee, prior to its execution by the applicant. The Director shall not issue a notice of the application's status pursuant to Section (c) below until after the applicant implements the citizen participation plan and submits to the Director a written report setting forth the results of the citizen participation plan as provided below.

a. All citizen participation plans shall include, at a minimum, the neighborhood civic association in which the development is located or to which it is adjacent. Projects within the central county neighborhoods shall include the Central County Community Advisory Board. A minimum of one (1) meeting shall be held with the affected community.

4. A written summary of the issues and/or concerns raised by residents and how the applicant proposes to resolve these issues and/or concerns. If the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve the issues, the summary should state the reason why these issues cannot be or were not resolved.

(b) _Review responsibilities._ Each review agency shall submit written comments and recommendations to the Urban Planning Division within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after acceptance of the application by the Urban Planning Division. If any reviewing agency report does not respond within said time frame, it shall be presumed that the agency has no comments or objections.

(c) _Reviewing agency reports; comments; required action._ The Urban Planning Division Director shall review the application, the citizen participation report, and the reports of the reviewing agencies.

(1) Within seven (7) days after receiving the reviewing comments and recommendations, the Urban Planning Division shall prepare a report and issue a notice of the status of the application.

a. For a site plan application found to be in compliance or conditionally in compliance, the notice shall state the application complies with the applicable standards and the minimum requirements of this article and that a development order will be granted, inclusive of any applicable conditions identified in the compiled report. The Urban Planning Division Director shall forward the compilation of such reviewing agency reports and the notice to the applicant and the County Commission. Each County Commissioner shall have fourteen (14) days after the date of transmittal of the notification to request that the application be placed on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda. Absent such request, the Urban Planning Division Director shall issue an order consistent with the notice.

b. For a site plan application found not to be in compliance with this article, the notice shall state the reason for noncompliance. The applicant shall have sixty (60) days after the date of the notice to address any noncompliance items identified by the review agencies. The resubmitted plan shall be routed pursuant to Section 39-413(a)(3) and ensuing reviews shall be noticed and processed pursuant to Section 39-413(c). Failure to submit corrections curing deficiencies identified in the notice shall result in issuance of another notice, together with the site plan report, to the applicant and the County Commission stating the intent to deny the site plan application. A County Commissioner shall have fourteen (14) days after the date of transmittal of the notification to request that the application be placed on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda. Absent such request, the Urban Planning Division Director shall issue an order consistent with the notice. Any further request will require a new site plan application submittal and may not be submitted any sooner than six (6) months after the date of the notice of noncompliance.

(2) All site plan applications shall be issued final orders consistent with the most recent notice within one hundred eighty (180) days after the application being deemed complete as set forth in Section 39-413(a)(2) above. The applicant may submit a written request for one (1) extension, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, provided the applicant agrees to waive Section 125.022, Florida Statutes.

(3) Notwithstanding Section 39-413(c), if the Director believes that there is a substantial question regarding the interpretation of this article as it applies to the application, the Director may place the matter on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda for consideration within one hundred eighty (180) days after the application was deemed complete, as set forth in Section 39-413(a)(1) above. If the application generates significant public interest, the Director may place the matter on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda for consideration within one hundred eighty (180) days after the application was deemed complete, as set forth in Section 39-413(a)(1) above.

(d) _Amendments; revised/changed site plan._ Revisions to development plans after issuance of a site plan approval/development order shall require the applicant to file an application with the Director.

# Sec. 39-1206. Purpose of district.

The provisions of these districts are intended to provide for single family detached dwellings and offices, conveniently located in low-density residential neighborhoods and designed to retain the character of a residential neighborhood. These zoning districts are intended to facilitate redevelopment of residential neighborhoods which have undergone certain radical changes such as widening of a heavily traveled street, or blight, structure obsolescence or maintenance neglect due to the pressures of economic conditions. The RSO District could act as a buffer or transitional zoning district between residential and commercial land uses.

(Ord. No. 80-67, § 1(1), 8-15-80; Ord. No. 2020-34 , § 1, 9-22-20)
