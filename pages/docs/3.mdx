### ARTICLE V. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
# 4

#### DIVISION 1. ADMINISTRATION

# Sec. 5-78. General.

(a) _Title._ This Article shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of unincorporated Broward County, hereinafter referred to as "this Article."

(b) _Scope._ The provisions of this Article shall apply to all development within the unincorporated area of Broward County that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, as defined herein, including but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation, or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the _Florida Building Code_; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development.

(c) _Intent._ The purposes of this Article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the _Florida Building Code_ are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through the regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:

(1) Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access, and public service during times of flooding;

(2) Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage;

(3) Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;

(4) Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain;

(5) Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;

(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas;

(7) Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and

(8) Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations ("C.F.R.") Section 59.22.

(d) _Coordination with the Florida Building Code._ This Article is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the _Florida Building Code_. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the _Florida Building Code_.

(e) _Warning._ The degree of flood protection required by this Article and the _Florida Building Code_, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by human-induced or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of 44 C.F.R. Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"), requiring revisions to these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this Article.

(f) _Disclaimer of Liability._ This Article shall not create liability on the part of the Broward County Board of County Commissioners ("Board"), or any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(Ord. No. 2014-13, § 2, 5-13-14)

# Sec. 5-79. Applicability.

(a) _General._ Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

(b) _Areas to which this Article applies._ This Article shall apply to all flood hazard areas within unincorporated Broward County, as established in Subsection 5-79(c) of this Article.

(c) _Variances._ The Board shall issue or deny variances based upon technical justifications submitted by applicants, the factors for issuance in Subsection 5-84(g) of this Article, the conditions for issuance set forth in Subsection 5-84(h) of this Article, and the comments and recommendations of the Floodplain Administrator and the Building Official. The Board has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this Article.

(d) _Restrictions in floodways._ A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in Subsection 5-82(c) of this Article.

(e) _Historic buildings._ A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the _Florida Building Code, Existing Building_, Chapter 11, Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the _Florida Building Code_.

(f) _Functionally dependent uses._ A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this Article, provided the variance meets the requirements of Subsection 5-84(d) of this Article, is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood.

(g) _Factors for consideration of variance requests._ In reviewing requests for variances, the Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors of this Article, all applicable provisions of the _Florida Building Code_, and the following:

(1) The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage;

(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(3) The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners;

(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community;

(5) The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion;

(6) The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development;

(7) The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area;

(8) The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(9) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters, and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

(10) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets, and bridges.

(h) _Conditions for issuance of variances._ The Board shall issue variances only upon:

(1) Submission by the applicant of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this Article, including the required elevation standards;

(2) Submission by the applicant of a signed statement that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Public Records of Broward County, Florida, in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land;

(3) Placement of a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, up to amounts as high as Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) for One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, if the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation; and

(4) Determinations by the Board that:

a. Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship;

b. The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with other existing local laws and ordinances; and

c. The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
