In all such cases, the landscape design shall take these offsite features into consideration so they will not conflict with each other, now or in the future, and will develop in harmony with the surrounding properties as the landscape normally matures.

(g) The landscape plan design shall consider proximity of proposed trees with both onsite and offsite features so that the development of tree roots will not destroy these features or infrastructure. Both canopy and the development of mature roots shall be considered when selecting tree species. Credit may be provided towards the required tree count, as described in Section 39-87(b)(2)(g), in cases where trees protrude onto the subject property.

(h) Solar panels on roofs or on the ground within the landscape area, if present or planned for the future, shall be taken into account when designing the species and tree placement of the landscaping on the subject property so as not to block sun access to the solar panels.

(i) The landscape plan design shall consider natural drainage features to minimize runoff. The use of pervious surfaces and areas is preferred; therefore, impervious surfaces and materials within the landscaped area shall be limited to borders, sidewalks, step stones, parking lots, and other similar materials, and shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the landscaped area. Use of pervious paving materials, where appropriate, is encouraged.

(j) The landscape plan design should consider the soil volume requirements for trees based on their size at maturity and their distance from any adjacent paved or hardscape areas and utility infrastructure. Larger soil volumes lead to greater tree size, better tree health, longer tree life, greater environmental benefits, and fewer costs, such as those associated with tree replacement and damage by roots to property improvements and infrastructure.

(k) For properties that are five (5) acres or less in size, reclaimed or nonpotable water should be used for irrigation if an acceptable source is determined to be available by the water provider and there is a reclaimed (reuse) water transmission line that is within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject property, as measured from the property line of the subject property. For properties larger than five (5) acres in size and that have a reclaimed (reuse) water transmission line within one thousand (1,000) feet of the subject property, as measured from the property line of the subject property, reclaimed (reuse) water shall be used for irrigation of the property.

(l) Landscape design shall conform to meet Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles.

Permeability rate - hydraulic conductivity rate shall be not less than one inch (1") per hour nor more than twenty inches (20") per hour, when tested in accordance with the USDA Handbook Number 60 (Diagnosis and Improvement of Saline and Alkaline Soils), method 34b, Hydraulic Conductivity of Disturbed Soils, or other approved method.

c. Fertility - the range of the essential elemental concentration in soil shall be as specified for its intended use.

(2) The use of solid waste compost as a soil amendment is encouraged, where it is appropriate.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 7, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-83. Appropriate plant, sod, and tree selection, location, and arrangement.

(a) _General._ Plant selection should be based on the plant's adaptability to the existing conditions present at the landscaped area and native plant communities, particularly considering appropriate hardiness zone, soil type and moisture conditions, light, mature plant size, desired effect, color, and texture. Plant species that are tolerant to drought, wind, or salt are preferred. Determinations of prohibited and controlled plant species shall be pursuant to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Chapter 5B-57, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), and the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FLEPPC) Invasive Plant Species list. Plant species identified as prohibited and controlled according to Chapter 5B-57, F.A.C., and the FLEPPC Invasive Plant Species list may not be used, except as specifically allowed therein.

(1) _Plant quality grades._ Plants used to meet the requirements of this article shall conform to the standards for Florida Grade One, or better, as provided in the most current edition of Florida Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, by the Division of Plant Industry, Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs, State of Florida. Sod shall be clean and visibly free of weeds, noxious pests, and diseases.

(2) _Native plant species._ Fifty percent (50%) of all vegetation, excluding turf, required to be planted by this article shall be vegetation native to South Florida, consistent with NatureScape landscape principles and Florida-Friendly LandscapingTM principles. Native and drought-tolerant landscaping shall be identified on the landscape plan in compliance with the zoning designation of the property, as indicated in Sections 39-85 and 39-87 of this article.

(3) _Invasive plants._ Prohibited and controlled plant species, pursuant to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Chapter 5B-57, FLEPPC Invasive Plant Species list, that are existing on site shall be removed.

(b) _Water requirements for plants._ Plants shall be grouped in accordance with their respective water (hydrozone) and maintenance needs consistent with Florida-Friendly LandscapingTM principles. Plants with similar water and cultural (soil, climate, sun, and light) requirements shall be grouped together (habitat). Consideration should be given to plantings that require minimal or no use of gasoline-powered maintenance equipment.

(1) The hydrozones shall be shown on the irrigation layout and planting plans, as required. Where natural conditions are such that irrigation is not required, the presence of site-appropriate plants shall not be considered a high water use hydrozone.

(2) For the purposes of the Code, hydrozones shall be grouped into the following hydrozone categories:

a. High water use hydrozone - typically annuals, grass, and sod;

b. Medium water use hydrozone - combination of a high and low water use hydrozone; and

c. Low water use hydrozone - drought tolerant plantings and most trees.

(3) The combined size of all high water use hydrozones, other than turf areas, shall be limited to twenty percent (20%) of the total landscaped area. In landscapes irrigated with reclaimed (reuse) water, the allowable size of all high water use zones shall not be limited. These high water use limits do not apply to landscaped areas requiring large amounts of turf for their primary functions.

(c) _Tree species._ Canopy trees shall be of a species having an average mature crown spread of greater than twenty (20) feet and shall have trunks that can be maintained with over six (6) feet of clear trunk. Trees or palms having an average mature crown spread of less than twenty (20) feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a twenty (20) foot crown spread. Such a grouping shall count as one (1) tree towards meeting tree requirements for any provision herein. Additional tree requirements and considerations are as follows:

(1) Tree sizes: Tree species shall have a minimum height as shown below at time of installation. Minimum canopy spread shall be characteristic of the species at such height.

a. Small trees (mature height of less than 15 feet): minimum tree size is 8 feet;

b. Medium trees (mature height of 15 feet - 25 feet): minimum tree size is 10 feet; and

c. Large trees (mature height of more than 25 feet): minimum tree size is 12 feet.

(2) Tree species diversity requirements: Based on the existing and required quantity of total trees required to meet the requirements of the Code for the subject property, the following conditions shall determine the number of differing species that will be required:

Preserved Trees + Existing Trees = Total Required Trees. Therefore, if:

a. Required trees = 6—10, then a minimum of two (2) species shall be used.

b. Required trees = 11—20, then a minimum of three (3) species shall be used.

c. Required trees = 21—50, then a minimum of four (4) species shall be used.

d. Required Trees = 51 or more, then a minimum of five (5) species shall be used.

These requirements are based on perimeter and interior requirement totals and calculations.

(3) Credit for existing native and noninvasive trees preserved on a site shall be granted towards meeting the tree requirements of any landscaping provisions of this article. No credit shall be granted for preserved trees that are in extremely poor condition or have a tree condition rating of 5.

(4) Trees used in the required landscaping adjacent to a public street or swale are subject to approval by the County so that the sustainable character, biological diversity of tree species, and safety of the public street can be maintained, the reduction of the urban heat island effect shall be encouraged, and Complete Streets and "walkable" communities shall be promoted.

(5) All large trees installed within six (6) feet of public infrastructure shall utilize a root barrier system, as approved by the County. Tree root barriers shall be installed at the sidewalk edge in those circumstances where tree roots are causing, or may potentially cause, a trip hazard because of lifting of some portions of a public sidewalk.

(6) Tree removal is to be conducted pursuant to Chapter 27, Article XIV, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances.

(d) _Palm species._ Palms shall be of a species that has an average mature crown spread of not less than fifteen (15) feet, or may be substituted with smaller palms by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of a twenty (20) foot crown spread, subject to the following:

(1) Palms shall have a minimum of six (6) feet of clear trunk or greywood at installation.

(2) Palms shall constitute no more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the total tree requirements.

(e) _Shrub species._ Shrubs used as hedges shall be a minimum height of two (2) feet, full to base, and planted two (2) feet on center when measured immediately after planting. When shrubs are used as a screen around vehicular open space areas, said shrubs shall be a minimum of two (2) feet in height above the vehicular open space pavement surface that directly abuts the shrubs at time of planting and, if within a safe sight distance triangle, shall be no greater than thirty (30) inches in height, in accordance to Section 39-88 of this article. Hedges required as a buffer shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken solid visual screen, with a minimum height of three (3) feet to be attained within one (1) year after planting. Use of several native species is preferable, but not required. When seen in profile, the upper portion of the hedge shall be narrower than the lower portion.

(f) _Vine species._ Vines shall be a minimum of thirty (30) inches in supported height immediately after planting, may be used in conjunction with fences, visual screens, or walls, and shall be planted at ten (10) foot intervals to meet landscape buffer requirements.

(g) _Groundcover species._ Groundcover shall be planted with a minimum of fifty percent (50%) coverage, with one hundred percent (100%) coverage occurring within six (6) months after installation.

(h) _Turf._ Turf areas shall be sodded using species suitable as permanent lawns in the County. Where appropriate, turf species that require minimum irrigation are encouraged. The type and location of turf areas shall be selected in the same manner as with all the other plantings. Irrigated turf areas, as opposed to nonirrigated turf areas, are considered to be high water use hydrozones. Irrigated turf shall not be treated as a fill-in material but rather as a planned element of the landscape. Turf shall be placed so that it can be irrigated using separate zones.

(1) Irrigated turf areas shall be consolidated and limited to those areas on the site that receive pedestrian traffic, provide for recreation use, provide cover for septic tank drainfields and required drainfield reserve areas, or provide soil erosion control, such as on slopes or in swales, and, in limited instances, where turf is used as a design unifier or other similar practical use.

(2) As a matter of public safety, no turf that requires mowing shall be allowed on slopes greater than four-to-one (4:1) or within ten (10) feet of the water's edge, except where adjacent to seawalls and bulkheads or needed to control erosion.

(3) Turf areas shall be identified on the landscape plan and be subject to the requirement that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the landscaped area for multifamily dwellings and other development uses (excluding single family residences and duplex dwellings, which are subject to the turf requirements set forth in Section 39-85 of this article) may be in turf.

(i) _Sustainable Sites._ LEED and Sustainable Sites concepts are encouraged in order to increase Green Infrastructure for sites being developed and to make them more environmentally conducive.

(1) The Sustainable Sites (SS) LEED category rewards decisions about the environment surrounding the building, with credits that emphasize the vital relationships among buildings, ecosystems, and ecosystem services. It focuses on restoring project site elements, integrating the site with local and regional ecosystems, and preserving the biodiversity relied upon by natural systems.

(2) The Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES®) is a program based on the understanding that land is a crucial component of the built environment and can be planned, designed, developed, and maintained to protect and enhance the benefits derived from healthy functioning landscapes.

All landscaping shall be installed according to accepted planting procedures with the quality of plants as described in Section 39-83 of this article.

(a) Topsoil shall be of the minimum quality as specified in Section 39-82 of this article. Excluding palm trees, all trees shall be planted with twelve (12) inches of topsoil around the root ball and shrubs shall be planted with a minimum of six (6) inches of topsoil around the root ball. A minimum of three (3) inches of shredded, approved, organic mulch or groundcover shall be installed around each tree planting, including palms, for a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches beyond its trunk in all directions and throughout all hedge and shrub planting. A six (6) inch clear area will be made around each trunk to prevent root rot and other damaging effects. The use of clean mulch (i.e., seeds killed) either recycled or obtained from Melaleuca, Eucalyptus, Australian Pine, or other nonold growth hardwood is encouraged in order to reduce impacts on the environment and to preserve the remaining native plant communities.

(b) All trees and palms shall be properly guyed and/or staked at the time of planting until establishment, which should not exceed more than seven (7) months for broadleaf trees and one (1) year for palms. The use of nails, wire, rope, or any other method which damages the trees or palms is prohibited. All plants shall be installed so that the top of the root ball remains even with, or slightly above, the soil grade.

(c) No large trees which are indicated as "Category 1 Trees" in Appendix 1 of Chapter 27, Article XIV, of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, shall be located closer than twelve (12) feet from streetlights. No palms shall be closer than seven (7) feet from streetlights. The spacing of trees from electric utility lines must follow those guidelines established by Florida Power and Light publication "Right Tree, Right Place," and the publication The Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Handbook, 2015, with Section #1: "Right Plant, Right Place."

(d) The soil volume around and adjacent to the tree should be adequate to allow for a healthy root zone based on the ultimate tree size at maturity.

(e) A layer of organic mulch three (3) inches deep shall be placed in plant beds, except annual beds, and individual trees in turf areas. Mulch rings should extend at least three (3) feet around freestanding trees and shrubs. Mulch should be at least six (6) inches away from any portion of a building or structure, or the trunks of trees, and at least three (3) inches away from the base of shrubs.

(f) Inspections of site for landscape installation:

(1) Prior to installation, a preinspection of the site by the County is required to determine conditions on the subject property and appropriate use and selection of landscape material.

(2) Before the landscape inspector makes the final inspection on commercial and industrial sites only, the landscape architect of record shall provide a certification letter to the County certifying that the landscaping was installed according to the plans and specifications.

(3) On commercial and industrial sites only, a final landscape inspection by the County will be required upon completion.

(g) When the landscaping has been installed and established by the contractor or installer, the owner of the property shall be subject to this article and shall be responsible for the maintenance of the land and landscaping so as to present a healthy, sustainable, vigorous, and neat appearance, free from refuse and debris.

# Sec. 39-92. Maintenance of landscaped areas and best management practices.

(a) _Required property maintenance of landscape areas._

(1) Property owners, including, but not limited to, owners of single family residences, multifamily dwellings, commercial sites, and industrial sites, are responsible for ensuring that landscaping that has been required to be planted pursuant to this article, or installed in compliance with the landscape requirements previously in effect, be maintained in a healthy condition. If landscaping is found to be in a state of decline, dead, or missing, it shall be replaced with native vegetation plant species that will be at least equivalent in size at maturity. If any preserved vegetation, which is being used to satisfy current landscape requirements of this article, dies, such vegetation shall be replaced with the same landscape material, if available, or comparable vegetation that complies with this article.

(2) Turf should be mowed frequently enough so that no more than one-third (1/3) of the blade height is removed per mowing.

(3) All mulch should be renewed periodically and maintained in accordance with the landscape plan standards in Section 39-79 of this article. Plastic sheeting and other impervious materials shall not be used under mulched areas.

(4) Preserved and created ecological communities shall be maintained in a natural state. Only clearing by hand is permissible, unless otherwise authorized by the EPGMD.

(b) _Best Management Practices (by owner)._

(1) All persons providing landscape maintenance services, commercial fertilizer applicator services, and institutional fertilizer applicator services within the County's unincorporated areas or on County properties, including County maintenance operations staff providing such services, shall:

a. Attend training in the Best Management Practices described in the most recent edition of the Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries (Florida Department of Environmental Protection); and

b. Have at least one (1) person holding a current certificate of completion for training as set forth in a. above present at all times on any job site while fertilizer application is in progress.

(2) In no case shall grass clippings, vegetative material, or vegetative debris be washed, swept, or blown off into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, water bodies, wetlands, sidewalks, or roadways, either intentionally or accidentally.

(3) Yard waste shall not be disposed of or stored by shorelines, ditches, swales, or the vicinity of storm drains. Yard waste and compost sites must be hidden from street view, maintained to prevent odor, and be free of weeds.

(4) Turf clippings should be left on the lawn to replace nutrients. Shredded yard clippings and leaves should be used for mulch or be composted for use as fertilizer. However, diseased material should not be mulched and should be properly disposed of to avoid spreading disease.

(5) Composting of yard waste provides many benefits and is strongly encouraged. Other recycled solid waste products are also available and should be used, when appropriate.

(6) Irrigation shall be maintained at its highest efficiency, as designed, and eliminate all free flow possibilities should any breaks occur in the main, lateral, or other piping within the system. In the event of such occurrence, the break(s) shall be repaired immediately.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 13, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-93. Conflicts and relationship to other laws.

Whenever regulations or restrictions imposed by this article conflict with other ordinances or regulations, or are either more or less restrictive than regulations or restrictions imposed by any governmental authority through legislation, rule, or regulation, the regulations, rules, or restrictions which are more restrictive or which impose the highest standards or requirements shall govern. Regardless of any other provision of this article, no land shall be used in a manner and no structure erected or maintained in violation of any state, local, or federal pollution control or environmental protection law, regulation, or ordinance.

(Ord. No. 2017-15 , § 24, 5-23-17)

# Sec. 39-94. Pervious area.

(a) The area covered by structures and impervious surface shall not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) for industrial, seventy percent (70%) for commercial, and sixty percent (60%) for residential uses. For the purposes of this requirement, all other uses, such as, but not limited to, utilities, transportation, and office park, shall be included in the commercial category. In mixed use developments, the most restrictive of the applicable impervious area limitations shall be utilized.

(1) Landscaping and setbacks, buffer strips, drain fields, passive recreation areas, or any other areas not covered with a material that prevents infiltration of water into the ground may satisfy the requirement for pervious area.

(2) When impervious material does not cover all the surface to which it is applied, credit towards the computation of the pervious area shall be given according to the percentage of pervious area that is retained.

a. Pervious paving blocks may not be used within major driveways, loading zones, actively used parking stalls in commercial or industrial developments, or any other area that may cause a liability to the property owner.

b. Pervious paving blocks may be used in overflow parking areas, park and recreation parking facilities, and residential areas. Where pedestrian traffic is prevalent, the voids in pervious paving blocks shall be planted with a nonrunner species of grass including, but not limited to, zoysia and Bermuda grass.

(3) Where this Zoning Code allows some required parking stalls to be grassed, the grassed parking stalls shall not be counted towards the computation of pervious area.

(4) Upon demonstration by the applicant that special conditions peculiar to the location or physical characteristics of a particular site are present, or special conditions resulting from the design of existing facilities or surrounding land uses are present, the Urban Planning Division Director may permit variation from the impervious area standards, subject to the following limitations:

a. Variation from the stated requirements shall be proportional to mitigating design improvements provided in excess of the minimum required engineering and landscaping standards. The impervious area shall not exceed eighty-five percent (85%) for industrial, eighty percent (80%) for commercial, and seventy percent (70%) for residential uses.

b. Mitigating design improvements may include the use of curvilinear berms to aid in screening; increased vegetation size and quantity, native species utilization, and preservation of existing significant vegetation to increase the quality of greenspace areas; the use of interlocking paving blocks along pedestrian walkways; and grassed retention basins and swales to aid in the filtration of storm water runoff.

(b) Each proposed development shall include provisions for the application of best management practices to enhance retention areas such as grass ponds, grass swales, french drains, or combinations thereof.
