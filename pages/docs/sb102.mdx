(b) This section does not prevent the enactment by local governments of public service rates otherwise authorized by law, including water, sewer, solid waste, public transportation, taxicab, or port rates, rates for towing of vehicles or vessels from or immobilization of vehicles or vessels on private property, or rates for removal and storage of wrecked or disabled vehicles or vessels from an accident scene or the removal and storage of vehicles or vessels in the event the owner or operator is incapacitated, unavailable, leaves the procurement of wrecker service to the law enforcement officer at the scene, or otherwise does not consent to the removal of the vehicle or vessel. (c) Counties must establish maximum rates which may be charged on the towing of vehicles or vessels from or immobilization of vehicles or vessels on private property, removal and storage of wrecked or disabled vehicles or vessels from an accident scene or for the removal and storage of vehicles or vessels, in the event the owner or operator is incapacitated, unavailable, leaves the procurement of wrecker service to the law enforcement officer at the scene, or otherwise does not consent to the removal of the vehicle or vessel. However, if a municipality chooses to enact an ordinance establishing the maximum rates for the towing or immobilization of vehicles or vessels as described in paragraph (b), the county’s ordinance does  not apply within such municipality.

### (7)(a)
A county must authorize multifamily and mixed-use residential as allowable uses in any area zoned for commercial, industrial, or mixed use if at least percent of the residential units in a proposed multifamily rental development are, for a period of at least years, affordable as defined in s. 420.0004.

Such land development regulations include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to setbacks and parking requirements. (e) A county must consider reducing parking requirements for a proposed development authorized under this subsection if the development is located within one-half mile of a major transit stop, as defined in the county’s land development code, and the major transit stop is accessible from the development.

# Section 7 #

### (1)(a)
Property used to provide affordable housing to eligible persons as defined by s. 159. and natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, low income, or moderate-income limits specified in s. 420.0004, which is owned entirely by a nonprofit entity that is a corporation not for profit, qualified as charitable under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and in compliance with Rev. Proc. 96-32, 1996- C.B. 717, is considered property owned by an exempt entity and used for a charitable purpose, and those portions of the affordable housing property that provide housing to natural persons or families classified as extremely low income, very low income, low income, or moderate income under s. 420. are exempt from ad valorem taxation to the extent authorized under s. 196.196. All property identified in this subsection must comply with the criteria provided under s. 196. for determining exempt status and applied by property appraisers on an annual basis. The Legislature intends that any property owned by a limited liability company which is disregarded as an entity for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) be treated as owned by its sole member. If the sole member of the limited liability company that owns the property is also a limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation 301.  3(b)(1)(ii), the Legislature intends that the property be treated as owned by the sole member of the limited liability company that owns the limited liability company that owns the property. Units that are vacant and units that are occupied by natural persons or families whose income no longer meets the income limits of this subsection, but whose income met those income limits at the time they became tenants, shall be treated as portions of the affordable housing property exempt under this subsection if a recorded land use restriction agreement in favor of the Florida Housing Finance Corporation or any other governmental or quasi-governmental jurisdiction requires that all residential units within the property be used in a manner that qualifies for the exemption under this subsection and if the units are being offered for rent. (b) Land that is owned entirely by a nonprofit entity that is a corporation not for profit, qualified as charitable under s. 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and in compliance with Rev. Proc. 96-32, 1996- C.B. 717, and is leased for a minimum of years for the purpose of, and is predominantly used for, providing housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, low-income, or moderate income limits specified in s. 420. is exempt from ad valorem taxation. For purposes of this paragraph, land is predominantly used for qualifying purposes if the square footage of the improvements on the land used to provide qualifying housing is greater than percent of the square footage of all improvements on the land. This paragraph first applies to the  tax roll and is repealed December 31, 2059.

### (3)(a)
As used in this subsection, the term: 1. “Corporation” means the Florida Housing Finance Corporation. 2. “Newly constructed” means an improvement to real property which was substantially completed within years before the date of an applicant’s first submission of a request for certification or an application for an exemption pursuant to this section, whichever is earlier. 3. “Substantially completed” has the same meaning as in s. 192.042(1). (b) Notwithstanding ss. 196. and 196.196, portions of property in a multifamily project are considered property used for a charitable purpose and are eligible to receive an ad valorem property tax exemption if such portions: 1. Provide affordable housing to natural persons or families meeting the income limitations provided in paragraph (d); 2. Are within a newly constructed multifamily project that contains more than units dedicated to housing natural persons or families meeting the income limitations provided in paragraph (d); and 3. Are rented for an amount that does not exceed the amount as specified by the most recent multifamily rental programs income and rent limit chart posted by the corporation and derived from the Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects Income Limits published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or percent of the fair market value rent as determined by a rental market study meeting the requirements of paragraph (m), whichever is less. (c) If a unit that in the previous year qualified for the exemption under this subsection and was occupied by a tenant is vacant on January 1, the vacant unit is eligible for the exemption if the use of the unit is restricted to providing affordable housing that would otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection and a reasonable effort is made to lease the unit to eligible persons or families. (d)1. Qualified property used to house natural persons or families whose annual household income is greater than  percent but not more than percent of the median annual adjusted gross income for households within the metropolitan statistical area or, if not within a metropolitan statistical area, within the county in which the person or family resides, must receive an ad valorem property tax exemption of percent of the assessed value. 2. Qualified property used to house natural persons or families whose annual household income does not exceed  percent of the median annual adjusted gross income for households within the metropolitan statistical area or, if not within a metropolitan statistical area, within the county in which the person or family resides, is exempt from ad valorem property taxes. (e) To receive an exemption under this subsection, a property owner must submit an application on a form prescribed by the department by March for the exemption, accompanied by a certification notice from the corporation to the property appraiser. (f) To receive a certification notice, a property owner must submit a request to the corporation for certification on a form provided by the corporation which includes all of the following: 1. The most recently completed rental market study meeting the requirements of paragraph (m). 2. A list of the units for which the property owner seeks an exemption. 3. The rent amount received by the property owner for each unit for which the property owner seeks an exemption. If a unit is vacant and qualifies for an exemption under paragraph (c), the property owner must provide evidence of the published rent amount for each vacant unit. 4. A sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, from the applicant restricting the property for a period of not less than  years to housing persons or families who meet the income limitations under this subsection. (g) The corporation shall review the request for certification and certify property that meets the eligibility criteria of this subsection. A determination by the corporation regarding a request for certification does not constitute final agency action pursuant to chapter 120. 1. If the corporation determines that the property meets the eligibility criteria for an exemption under this subsection, the corporation must send a certification notice to the property owner and the property appraiser. 2. If the corporation determines that the property does not meet the eligibility criteria, the corporation must notify the property owner and include the reasons for such determination. (h) The corporation shall post on its website the deadline to submit a request for certification. The deadline must allow adequate time for a property owner to submit a timely application for exemption to the property appraiser. (i) The property appraiser shall review the application and determine if the applicant is entitled to an exemption. A property appraiser may grant an exemption only for a property for which the corporation has issued a certification notice. (j) If the property appraiser determines that for any year during the immediately previous years a person who was not entitled to an exemption under this subsection was granted such an exemption, the property appraiser must serve upon the owner a notice of intent to record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person in the county, and that property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Any property owned by the taxpayer and situated in this state is subject to the taxes exempted by the improper exemption, plus a penalty of percent of the unpaid taxes for each year and interest at a rate of percent per annum. If an exemption is improperly granted as a result of a clerical mistake or an omission by the property appraiser, the property owner improperly receiving the exemption may not be assessed a penalty or interest. (k) Units subject to an agreement with the corporation pursuant to chapter recorded in the official records of the county in which the property is located to provide housing to natural persons or families meeting the extremely-low-income, very-low-income, or low-income limits specified in s. 420.  are not eligible for this exemption. (l) Property receiving an exemption pursuant to s. 196.  is not eligible for this exemption. (m) A rental market study submitted as required by paragraph (f) must identify the fair market value rent of each unit for which a property owner seeks an exemption. Only a certified general appraiser as defined in s. 475. may issue a rental market study. The certified general appraiser must be independent of the property owner who requests the rental market study. In preparing the rental market study, a certified general appraiser shall comply with the standards of professional practice pursuant to part II of chapter and use comparable property within the same geographic area and of the same type as the property for which the exemption is sought. A rental market study must have been completed within years before submission of the application. (n) The corporation may adopt rules to implement this section. (o) This subsection first applies to the tax roll and is repealed December 31, 2059.

The schedule shall provide a management tool that facilitates development of performance measures. 5. A summary budget for the scheduled land management activities of the land management plan. For state lands containing or anticipated to contain imperiled species habitat, the summary budget shall include any fees anticipated from public or private entities for projects to offset adverse impacts to imperiled species or such habitat, which fees shall be used solely to restore, manage, enhance, repopulate, or acquire imperiled species habitat. The summary budget shall be prepared in such manner that it facilitates computing an aggregate of land management costs for all state-managed lands using the categories described in s. 259.037(3). (d) Upon completion, the land management plan must be transmitted to the Acquisition and Restoration Council for review. The council shall have days after receipt of the plan to review the plan and submit its recommendations to the board of trustees. During the review period, the land management plan may be revised if agreed to by the primary land manager and the council taking into consideration public input. The land management plan becomes effective upon approval by the board of trustees. (e) Land management plans are to be updated every years on a rotating basis. Each updated land management plan must identify any conservation lands under the plan, in part or in whole, that are no longer needed for conservation purposes and could be disposed of in fee simple or with the state retaining a permanent conservation easement. (f) In developing land management plans, at least one public hearing shall be held in any one affected county. (g) The Division of State Lands shall make available to the public an electronic copy of each land management plan for parcels that exceed acres in size. The division shall review each plan for compliance with the requirements of this subsection, the requirements of chapter 259, and the requirements of the rules adopted by the board of trustees pursuant to this section. The Acquisition and Restoration Council shall also consider the propriety of the recommendations of the managing entity with regard to the future use of the property, the protection of fragile or nonrenewable resources, the potential for alternative or multiple uses not recognized by the managing entity, and the possibility of disposal of the property by the board of trustees.

LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—It is the intent of this act to articulate a state housing strategy that will carry the state toward the goal of ensuring that each Floridian has safe, decent, and affordable housing. This strategy must involve state and local governments working in partnership with communities and the private sector and must involve financial, as well as regulatory, commitment to accomplish this goal.

## (2)
POLICIES.— (a) Housing production and rehabilitation programs. Programs to encourage housing production or rehabilitation must be guided by the following general policies, as appropriate for the purpose of the specific program: 1. State and local governments shall provide incentives to encourage the private sector to be the primary delivery vehicle for the development of affordable housing. When possible, state funds should be heavily leveraged to achieve the maximum federal, local, and private commitment of funds and be used to ensure long-term affordability. To the maximum extent possible, state funds should be expended to create new housing stock and be used for repayable loans rather than grants. Local incentives to stimulate private sector development of affordable housing may include establishment of density bonus incentives. 2. State and local governments should consider and implement innovative solutions to housing issues where appropriate. Innovative solutions include, but are not limited to: a. Utilizing publicly held land to develop affordable housing through state or local land purchases, long-term land leasing, and school district affordable housing programs. To the maximum extent possible, state-owned lands that are appropriate for the development of affordable housing must be made available for that purpose. b. Community-led planning that focuses on urban infill, flexible zoning, redevelopment of commercial property into mixed-use property, resiliency, and furthering development in areas with preexisting public services, such as wastewater, transit, and schools. c. Project features that maximize efficiency in land and resource use, such as high density, high rise, and mixed use. d. Mixed-income projects that facilitate more diverse and successful communities. e. Modern housing concepts such as manufactured homes, tiny homes, 3D-printed homes, and accessory dwelling units. 3. State funds should be available only to local governments that provide incentives or financial assistance for housing. State funding for housing should not be made available to local governments whose comprehensive plans have been found not in compliance with chapter and who have not entered into a stipulated settlement agreement with the department to bring the plans into compliance. State funds should be made available only for projects consistent with the local government’s comprehensive plan. 4. Local governments are encouraged to enter into interlocal agreements, as appropriate, to coordinate strategies and maximize the use of state and local funds. 5. State-funded development should emphasize use of developed land, urban infill, and the transformation of existing infrastructure in order to minimize sprawl, separation of housing from employment, and effects of increased housing on ecological preservation areas. Housing available to the state’s workforce should prioritize proximity to employment and services. (b) Public-private partnerships.—Cost-effective public private partnerships must emphasize production and preservation of affordable housing. 1. Data must be developed and maintained on the affordable housing activities of local governments, community-based organizations, and private developers. 2. The state shall assist local governments and community based organizations by providing training and technical assistance. 3. In coordination with local activities and with federal initiatives, the state shall provide incentives for public sector and private sector development of affordable housing. (c) Preservation of housing stock.—The existing stock of affordable housing must be preserved and improved through rehabilitation programs and expanded neighborhood revitalization efforts to promote suitable living environments for individuals and families. (d) Unique housing needs.—The wide range of need for safe, decent, and affordable housing must be addressed, with an emphasis on assisting the neediest persons. 1. State housing programs must promote the self-sufficiency and economic dignity of the people of this state, including elderly persons and persons with disabilities. 2. The housing requirements of special needs populations must be addressed through programs that promote a range of housing options bolstering integration with the community. 3. All housing initiatives and programs must be nondiscriminatory. 4. The geographic distribution of resources must provide for the development of housing in rural and urban areas. 5. The important contribution of public housing to the well-being of citizens in need shall be acknowledged through efforts to continue and bolster existing programs. State and local government funds allocated to enhance public housing must be used to supplement, not supplant, federal support.

## (3)
IMPLEMENTATION.—The state, in carrying out the strategy articulated in this section, shall have the following duties: (a) State fiscal resources must be directed to achieve the following programmatic objectives: 1. Effective technical assistance and capacity-building programs must be established at the state and local levels. 2. The Shimberg Center for Housing Studies at the University of Florida shall develop and maintain statewide data on housing needs and production, provide technical assistance relating to real estate development and finance, operate an information clearinghouse on housing programs, and coordinate state housing initiatives with local government and federal programs. 3. The corporation shall maintain a consumer-focused website for connecting tenants with affordable housing. (b) The long-range program plan of the department must include specific goals, objectives, and strategies that implement the housing policies in this section. (c) The Shimberg Center for Housing Studies at the University of Florida, in consultation with the department and the corporation, shall perform functions related to the research and planning for affordable housing. Functions must include quantifying affordable housing needs, documenting results of programs administered, and inventorying the supply of affordable housing units made available in this state. The recommendations required in this section and a report of any programmatic modifications made as a result of these policies must be included in the housing report required by s. 420.6075. The report must identify the needs of specific populations, including, but not limited to, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and persons with special needs, and may recommend statutory modifications when appropriate. (d) The Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) shall evaluate affordable housing issues pursuant to the schedule set forth in this paragraph. OPPAGA may coordinate with and rely upon the expertise and research activities of the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies in conducting the evaluations. The analysis may include relevant reports prepared by the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, the department, the corporation, and the provider of the Affordable Housing Catalyst Program; interviews with the agencies, providers, offices, developers, and other organizations related to the development and provision of affordable housing at the state and local levels; and any other relevant data. When appropriate, each report must recommend policy and statutory modifications for consideration by the Legislature. Each report must be submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives pursuant to the schedule. OPPAGA shall review and evaluate: 1. By December 15, 2023, and every years thereafter, innovative affordable housing strategies implemented by other states, their effectiveness, and their potential for implementation in this state. 2. By December 15, 2024, and every years thereafter, affordable housing policies enacted by local governments, their effectiveness, and which policies constitute best practices for replication across this state. The report must include a review and evaluation of the extent to which interlocal cooperation is used, effective, or hampered. 3. By December 15, 2025, and every years thereafter, existing state-level housing rehabilitation, production, preservation, and finance programs to determine their consistency with relevant policies in this section and effectiveness in providing affordable housing. The report must also include an evaluation of the degree of coordination between housing programs of this state, and between state, federal, and local housing activities, and shall recommend improved program linkages when appropriate. (e) The department and the corporation should conform the administrative rules for each housing program to the policies stated in this section, provided that such changes in the rules are consistent with the statutory intent or requirements for the program. This authority applies only to programs offering loans, grants, or tax credits and only to the extent that state policies are consistent with applicable federal requirements.

LIVE LOCAL TAX CREDITS; APPLICATIONS, TRANSFERS, AND LIMITATIONS.— (a) Beginning in the 2023- fiscal year, the tax credit cap amount is $ million in each state fiscal year. (b) Beginning October 1, 2023, a taxpayer may submit an application to the Department of Revenue for an allocation of the tax credit cap for tax credits to be taken under either or both of s. 220. or s. 624.51058. 1. The taxpayer shall specify in the application each tax for which the taxpayer requests a credit and the applicable taxable year. For purposes of s. 220.1878, a taxpayer may apply for a credit to be used for a prior taxable year before the date the taxpayer is required to file a return for that year pursuant to s. 220.222. For purposes of s. 624.51058, a taxpayer may apply for a credit to be used for a prior taxable year before the date the taxpayer is required to file a return for that prior taxable year pursuant to ss. 624. and 624.5092. The Department of Revenue shall approve tax credits on a first-come, first-served basis. 2. Within days after approving or denying an application, the Department of Revenue shall provide a copy of its approval or denial letter to the corporation. (c) If a tax credit approved under paragraph (b) is not fully used for the specified taxable year for credits under s. 220. or s. 624. because of insufficient tax liability on the part of the taxpayer, the unused amount may be carried forward for a period not to exceed taxable years. For purposes of s. 220.1878, a credit carried forward may be used in a subsequent year after applying the other credits and unused carryovers in the order provided in s. 220.02(8). (d) A taxpayer may not convey, transfer, or assign an approved tax credit or a carryforward tax credit to another entity unless all of the assets of the taxpayer are conveyed, assigned, or transferred in the same transaction. However, a tax credit under s. 220. or s. 624. may be conveyed, transferred, or assigned between members of an affiliated group of corporations if the type of tax credit under s. 220. or s. 624. remains the same. A taxpayer shall notify the Department of Revenue of its intent to convey, transfer, or assign a tax credit to another member within an affiliated group of corporations. The amount conveyed, transferred, or assigned is available to another member of the affiliated group of corporations upon approval by the Department of Revenue. (e) Within any state fiscal year, a taxpayer may rescind all or part of a tax credit allocation approved under paragraph (b). The amount rescinded must become available for that state fiscal year to another eligible taxpayer as approved by the Department of Revenue if the taxpayer receives notice from the Department of Revenue that the rescindment has been accepted by the Department of Revenue. Any amount rescinded under this paragraph must become available to an eligible taxpayer on a first-come, first-served basis based on tax credit applications received after the date the rescindment is accepted by the Department of Revenue. (f) Within days after approving or denying the conveyance, transfer, or assignment of a tax credit under paragraph (d), or the rescindment of a tax credit under paragraph (e), the Department of Revenue shall provide a copy of its approval or denial letter to the corporation. (g) For purposes of calculating the underpayment of estimated corporate income taxes under s. 220. and tax installment payments for taxes on insurance premiums or assessments under s. 624.5092, the final amount due is the amount after credits earned under s. 220. or s. 624.  for contributions to eligible charitable organizations are deducted. 1. For purposes of determining if a penalty or interest under s. 220.34(2)(d)1. will be imposed for underpayment of estimated corporate income tax, a taxpayer may, after earning a credit under s. 220.1878, reduce any estimated payment in that taxable year by the amount of the credit. 2. For purposes of determining if a penalty under s. 624. will be imposed, an insurer, after earning a credit under s. 624. for a taxable year, may reduce any installment payment for such taxable year of percent of the amount of the net tax due as reported on the return for the preceding year under s. 624.5092(2)(b) by the amount of the credit.

## (4)
PRESERVATION OF CREDIT.—If any provision or portion of this section, s. 220.1878, or s. 624. or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held unconstitutional by any court or is otherwise declared invalid, the unconstitutionality or invalidity does not affect any credit earned under s. 220. or s. 624. by any taxpayer with respect to any contribution paid to the Live Local Program before the date of a determination of unconstitutionality or invalidity. The credit must be allowed at such time and in such a manner as if a determination of unconstitutionality or invalidity had not been made, provided that nothing in this subsection by itself or in combination with any other provision of law may result in the allowance of any credit to any taxpayer in excess of $ of credit for each dollar paid to an eligible charitable organization.

## (5)
ADMINISTRATION; RULES.— (a) The Department of Revenue and the corporation may develop a cooperative agreement to assist in the administration of this section, as needed.

(c) By August 15, 2023, and by each August thereafter, the Department of Revenue shall determine the taxpayers with the greatest total corporate income or franchise tax due as reported on the taxpayer’s return filed pursuant to s. 220.  during the previous calendar year and notify those taxpayers of the existence of the Live Local Program and the process for obtaining an allocation of the tax credit cap. The Department of Revenue shall confer with the corporation in the drafting of the notification. The Department of Revenue may provide this notification by electronic means.

## (1)
The Legislature finds that individual homeownership is vital to building long-term housing and financial security. With rising home prices, down payment and closing costs are often significant barriers to homeownership for working Floridians. Each person in Florida’s hometown workforce is essential to creating thriving communities, and the Legislature finds that the ability of Floridians to reside within the communities in which they work is of great importance. Therefore, the Legislature finds that providing assistance to homebuyers in this state by reducing the amount of down payment and closing costs is a necessary step toward expanding access to homeownership and achieving safe, decent, and affordable housing for all Floridians.

## (2)
The Florida Hometown Hero Program is created to assist Florida’s hometown workforce in attaining homeownership by providing financial assistance to residents to purchase a home as their primary residence. Under the program, a borrower may apply to the corporation for a loan to reduce the amount of the down payment and closing costs paid by the borrower by a minimum of $10, and up to percent of the first mortgage loan, not exceeding $35,000. Loans must be made available at a zero percent interest rate and must be made available for the term of the first mortgage. The balance of any loan is due at closing if the property is sold, refinanced, rented, or transferred, unless otherwise approved by the corporation.

A borrower must be seeking to purchase a home as a primary residence; a first-time homebuyer and a Florida resident; and employed full-time by a Florida-based employer. The borrower must provide documentation of full-time employment, or full-time status for self-employed individuals, of hours or more per week. The requirement to be a first-time homebuyer does not apply to a borrower who is an active duty servicemember of a branch of the armed forces or the Florida National Guard, as defined in s. 250.01, or a veteran.
