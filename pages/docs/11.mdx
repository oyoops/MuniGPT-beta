a. Dumpsters shall only be located on plots where an accessory building is located. Such dumpsters shall be kept within opaque or translucent enclosures and shall not be located within any required yard or setback area.

b. Dumpsters shall be maintained free of jagged or sharp edges or inside parts which could prevent the free discharge of their contents.

c. Dumpsters shall be emptied by a licensed collector at intervals which will preclude overflow. Dumpsters and the area around the dumpster and dumpster enclosure shall not be used for disposal of furniture or major appliances and shall be maintained by the property owner free of overflowing refuse at all times. If a continuous problem of insufficient dumpster capacity is proven to exist, additional or larger capacity dumpsters and enclosures or increased frequency of pick-up shall be required in order to eliminate the overflow problem.

d. All dumpster pads shall be at least two (2) feet larger than the dumpster on all sides. Wheel stops or posts shall be permanently affixed to the pad at least one foot inside the perimeter of the pad to prevent the dumpster from striking the enclosure during collection.

e. Dumpsters and dumpster enclosures shall be located in a position accessible for collection by the equipment of the collector.

f. Dumpster enclosures shall be constructed so as to accommodate recycling bins, if over forty (40) gallons.

g. The gates of the enclosure shall be constructed of a frame with opaque or translucent walls affixed thereto, and both frame and walls shall be of a material of sufficient strength to withstand normal use. Gates shall be attached to metal posts at least three (3) inches in diameter with at least two (2) hinges. Each gate shall have a wheel at the bottom to prevent sagging and shall have drop pins or rods to hold the gates in place in both open and closed positions.

h. The base of the enclosure must be poured concrete in accordance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code. The base shall extend three (3) feet beyond the front opening of the enclosure as an apron, and all concrete must be level with the adjacent surface.

### ARTICLE XXV. RESILIENCY STANDARDS FOR TIDAL FLOOD PROTECTION

# Sec. 39-404. Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this article is to establish a consistent minimum elevation for tidal flood barriers that will:

(a) Provide a standard for flood mitigation infrastructure that serves as a barrier to tidal flooding, not seepage, by accounting for water levels predicted under combined conditions of sea level rise, high tides, and high frequency storm surge through the year 2070; and

(b) Ensure new shoreline structures and major shoreline improvements are designed for use as tidal flood barriers through application of consistent standards that account for future predicted tidal flood conditions and coastal water levels associated with sea level rise in accordance with current regional sea level rise projections, as updated and adopted by the Broward County Board of County Commissioners.

( Ord. No. 2020-11 , § 1, 3-31-20)

# Sec. 39-405. Applicability.

This article applies to all new tidal flood barriers, substantial repair or substantial rehabilitation to shorelines and shoreline structures, and the installation of any fixed infrastructure attached to tidal flood barriers (such as mooring structures). This article is not applicable to oceanfront beaches or shorelines seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line.

( Ord. No. 2020-11 , § 1, 3-31-20)

# Sec. 39-406. Definitions.

For the purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivation shall have the meanings given herein, except when the context clearly indicates a different meaning. In the interpretation and application of this article, the definitions provided for herein shall control over definitions that may be included in other documents or manuals, including, but not limited to, the Florida Building Code. Words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number. The word "shall" is mandatory and the word "may" is permissive.

_Bank_ means the level space separating a waterway from an inland area, often elevated and constructed of compacted soil.

_Berm_ means an earthen mound designed with impermeability to resist the flow of tidal waters through it to an adjacent property or public right-of-way.

_Green-grey infrastructure_ or _green-grey materials_ means a combination of engineered and natural features that provide environmental qualities and ecosystem value.

_Mooring structure_ means a boat dock, slip, davit, hoist, lift, floating vessel platform, mooring pile, or similar structure attached to land or to a seawall, to which a vessel can be moored.

_North American Vertical Datum (NAVD88)_ means the vertical control for datum of orthometric height established for vertical control surveying in the United States of America based upon the General Adjustment of the North American Datum of 1988.

_Public nuisance_ means a condition injurious to the public health or safety of the community or neighborhood, or injurious to any considerable number of persons, or a condition that obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any public right-of-way.

_Rip-rap_ means a foundation of unconsolidated boulders, stone, rubble, concrete without protruding rebar, or similar materials placed on or near a shoreline to mitigate wave impacts and prevent erosion.

_Seawall_ means a vertical or near vertical (often interlocking) structure placed between an upland area and a waterway or waterbody for erosion control.

_Seawall cap_ means a concrete box structure (usually reinforced) that connects seawall panels, piles, and anchoring system (if present) together at the top.

_Shoreline_ means a tidally influenced area where land meets water.

_Substantial repair_ or _substantial rehabilitation_ means:

(a) Any modification to the shoreline or a shoreline structure along more than fifty percent (50%) of the length of the property's shoreline; or

(b) Any modification, alteration, or installation of an appurtenant structure (such as a mooring structure) that exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the cost of a tidal flood barrier along the property's shoreline.

_Tidal flood barrier_ means any structure or shoreline feature including, but not limited to, banks, berms, green-grey infrastructure, seawalls, seawall caps, upland stem walls, or other infrastructure that impedes tidal waters from flowing onto adjacent property or public right-of-way, and located within or along a tidally influenced area. This definition is not meant to include rip-rap, derelict erosion control structures, or permeable earthen mounds that do not provide an impermeable water barrier to tidal flooding.

_Tidally influenced area_ means the real property adjacent to, or affected by, a waterway with water level changes in response to the daily tide.

( Ord. No. 2020-11 , § 1, 3-31-20)

# Sec. 39-407. Minimum elevations for coastal infrastructure within tidally influenced areas.

(a) All new or substantially repaired or substantially rehabilitated banks, berms, green-grey infrastructure, seawalls, seawall caps, upland stem walls, or other similar infrastructure shall be designed and constructed to perform as tidal flood barriers. Tidal flood barriers shall have a minimum elevation of five (5) feet NAVD88. Applications for new or substantially repaired or substantially rehabilitated tidal flood barriers submitted prior to January 1, 2035, may be permitted a minimum elevation of four (4) feet NAVD88, if designed and constructed to accommodate a minimum elevation of five (5) feet NAVD88 by January 1, 2050.

(b) All property owners must maintain a tidal flood barrier in good repair. A tidal flood barrier is presumed to be in disrepair if it allows tidal waters to flow unimpeded through or over the barrier and onto adjacent property or public right-of-way. Failure to maintain a tidal flood barrier in good repair shall be a citable offense. The owner of the tidal flood barrier shall demonstrate progress towards repairing the cited defect within sixty (60) days after receiving a citation and shall complete repairs within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after receipt of the citation. If the required repair or rehabilitation meets the substantial repair or substantial rehabilitation threshold, no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days after receipt of the citation, the property owner shall design, obtain permits, cause to be constructed, and obtain final inspection approval of seawall improvements that meet the minimum elevation and design requirements.

(c) Tidal flood barriers below a minimum five (5) feet NAVD88 elevation shall be improved, designed, and constructed so as to prevent tidal waters from impacting adjacent property or public right-of-way. Causing, suffering, or allowing the trespass of tidal waters onto adjacent property or public right-of-way is hereby declared a public nuisance and a citable offense requiring abatement. The owner shall demonstrate progress toward addressing the cited concern within sixty (60) days after receipt of the citation and complete the construction of an approved remedy no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days after receipt of the citation.

(d) Tidal flood barriers shall be designed and constructed to prevent tidal waters from flowing through the barrier, while still allowing for the release of upland hydrostatic pressure.

(e) To the extent practicable, tidal flood barriers shall be designed and constructed to adjoin immediately proximate tidal flood barriers to close gaps and prevent trespass of tidal water.

(f) All tidal flood barriers undergoing substantial repair or substantial rehabilitation shall be constructed along the property's entire shoreline.

(g) All tidal flood barriers shall be constructed with natural limerock rip-rap, or other approved habitat enhancement, at the waterward face of the structure.

(h) Property owners are encouraged to consider approaches and materials that enhance the biological value of traditional (flat surface) seawalls and flood barriers with the incorporation of living shoreline features, use of hybrid green-grey materials, and the use of biological forms, where practicable.

(i) This section shall not be construed to require the installation of a seawall where other flood protection measures serve as an equally effective tidal flood barrier.

(j) Tidal flood barriers capable of automatically being elevated in advance of high tides to prevent tidal flooding are permissible, provided that automation cannot require daily human intervention.

( Ord. No. 2020-11 , § 1, 3-31-20)

# Sec. 39-408. Required disclosure in contracts for sale of real estate.

In any contract for the sale of real estate located in tidally influenced areas of Broward County executed after December 31, 2020, the seller shall include in the contract or a rider to the contract the following disclosure in not less than fourteen-point, capitalized, bold-faced type:

# Sec. 39-412. Courtesy conceptual site plan meeting.

(a) Depending on the location, design, size, impact, or other factor of a proposed development, the Urban Planning Division Director may require an applicant to file an application for Conceptual Review of the site plan prior to filing a site plan application. The Conceptual Review is not a replacement for the full site plan application review procedure and does not qualify as a preapplication meeting.

(1) Review for completeness of a Conceptual Review application shall not be required as the review is merely conceptual. However, insufficient information may result in additional requests.

(2) When applicable, the Director shall forward the application for Conceptual Review consistent with Section 39-413(a)(3).

(3) The Urban Planning Division shall schedule a meeting with the applicant and the selected review agencies to discuss the conceptual site plans.

(4) When not required, an applicant has the option to file an application for Conceptual Review of the site plan prior to requesting a preapplication consultation.

(b) No formal comments, interpretation of the Code, or order shall be issued in conjunction with a Conceptual Review application.

( Ord. No. 2022-22 , § 17, 5-11-22)

# Sec. 39-413. Site plan review procedures.

(a) _Application Procedure._ The following procedures shall govern the review of applications:

(1) _Preapplication Required._ Prior to the filing of a site plan application, the applicant shall attend a preapplication meeting with the Urban Planning Division staff to discuss filing requirements, including the submission requirements in Table 1 above, municipal and neighborhood notification procedures, application fee, sign posting procedures, and any other issues that may affect the application. A site plan application shall not be accepted or deemed complete until this meeting has occurred.

(2) _Completeness of application._ The Urban Planning Division shall review the application to determine the completeness of required submittals based on Table 1 above. Within seven (7) days after receipt, the Urban Planning Division shall either:

a. Find that the application is complete and initiate the review process commencing on the eighth (8th) day after filing; or

b. Reject the application and forward to the applicant with a notice of incompleteness specifying the information missing from the application. The applicant shall resubmit the application with the information required within ten (10) days after the transmittal of the notice of incompleteness, or the application shall be deemed withdrawn. The Urban Planning Division shall review the resubmitted application in the manner provided in this section for the original application.

(3) _Agency Review._

a. The Director shall determine to which agencies the application shall be routed based upon the type of application submitted, the intensity/density of the proposed development, and whether the application is relevant to that reviewing agency. Each agency shall review the plan in accordance with its applicable laws, rules, and procedures. The reviewing agencies are as follows:

1. School Board of Broward County, Florida;

2. Building Code Division;

3. Parks and Recreation Division;

4. Aviation Department;

5. Broward Sheriff's Office Fire Marshal's Bureau;

6. Broward County Health Department (BCHD);

7. Water and Wastewater Services;

8. Urban Planning Division;

9. Consumer Protection Division;

10. Environmental Resources Division;

11. Environmental Permitting Division;

12. Broward County Transportation Department;

13. Traffic Engineering Division;

14. Highway Construction and Engineering Division; and

15. Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), for applications where the property abuts a trafficway that is functionally classified as a state road, and propose direct vehicle access to a state road.

b. The Director may waive agency review, in whole or in part, under this section upon a determination that such a review has already been made regarding the same land and no change in circumstances has occurred that necessitates further review, or upon a determination by the Director that further review is not necessary.

c. Additional matters to be addressed with an application for site plan:

1. The Broward County Health Department (BCHD) assesses availability of facilities by applying a gallons-per-day design flow demand rate to the proposed development and then determining whether the proposed development's demand will exceed the licensed capacity of the treatment plant, considering the existing utilized and "committed" capacity. The BCHD uses potable water design flow rates set forth in the Water Management Element of the Broward County Comprehensive Plan to assess adequacy of service at the time of site plan application for those properties that are not required to be platted. If the proposed land use does not have a potable water demand rate set forth in the Water Management Element, the BCHD is authorized to assign the most suitable rate.

2. Site plan applications involving residential uses shall be forwarded to the School Board of Broward County, Florida, for a determination as to whether the project is exempt from the requirements of public school concurrency, consistent with Chapter 5 of Broward County's Land Development Code, and the Public School Facilities Interlocal Agreement.

3. If a site plan application includes all or any part of any lands identified as a site recommended for inclusion in the Urban Wilderness Inventory by the Urban Wilderness Advisory Board pursuant to Chapter 25½ of the Code, which recommendation has been approved by the County Commission; or a site designated as a Native Vegetative Communities Category Local Area of Particular Concern within the Broward County Land Use Plan; or subject to notice of a public hearing regarding designation as a Native Vegetative Communities Category Local Area of Particular Concern or inclusion in the Urban Wilderness Inventory, which is mailed any time before a site plan application is filed, then the Urban Planning Division Director shall provide for the preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) consistent with Section 5-182.8 of the Land Development Code.

4. If the Broward County Aviation Department determines that the site plan application includes property that is or may be subject to the notice requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, Subpart B, the applicant must obtain and submit an FAA determination that it does not constitute a hazard to air navigation or require operational modifications to the airport to avoid such a hazard.

(4) _Municipal Notification._ Upon acceptance of a site plan application for public or regional facilities, such as highway rest stations, transit infrastructure, landfills, government facilities, or similar uses, a copy of the application, including all attachments and drawings, shall be forwarded by the Urban Planning Division Director, electronically or by hard copy, to any municipality within a four (4) mile radius of a boundary of the site plan and to any unincorporated area neighborhood/civic organizations within a one (1) mile radius of the site plan boundary, as listed on the "Neighborhood Association/Civic Representatives List for the Broward Municipal Services District" and as delineated on the "Broward Municipal Services District Map." Municipalities and neighborhood/civic organizations shall have the same time limits as reviewing agencies to provide written comments to the Director, as specified in Section 39-413(b). Comments received from municipalities and neighborhood/civic organizations shall be attached to the compilation of comments forwarded to the applicant in accordance with Section 39-413(b) and shall be considered by the Urban Planning Division Director only as they relate to compliance with the Code.

(5) _Posted Notice._ Notice of submittal of a site plan application must be provided by the applicant by posting, in accordance with this section. The applicant must securely post the sign(s) on the property in a visible location on each street frontage and shall submit to the Urban Planning Division an affidavit, including date-stamped photographic proof, of posting of the sign(s) in accordance with this section. If the applicant fails to submit the affidavit, processing of the application shall cease and any required action by the Director shall be postponed until such affidavit is received. The following requirements must be followed by the applicant for signage posting:

**Public Notification Signage Posting for Site Plan Approval**

| Number of signs | One (1) at the center of each property line of the project site that fronts on a public roadway. |
| --- | --- |
| Signage size requirements | No less than three (3) feet wide by two (2) feet high, with white background and black letters, and Arial font size no less than three (3) inches in height per letter. |
| Sign Update | Posted sign shall be updated by the applicant in the event the application is scheduled for quasi-judicial hearing. The update shall reflect the date, time, and location of the quasi-judicial hearing. |
| Removal, if administrative | Posted sign shall be removed within five (5) business days after issuance of agency administrative approval(s). |
| Removal, if referred to County Commission | Posted sign shall be removed within five (5) business days after final disposition of the application by the County Commission. |

\*If the applicant fails to remove the sign(s) within the time frames above, the County shall have the right to remove the sign(s).

(6) _Public Participation Plan._ For site plans located within an enclave identified within the BMSD Land Use Plan, that consist of four (4) or more residential units, new commercial, mixed use, and industrial uses shall include a plan for citizen participation. Commercial and industrial renovations or changes of use requiring a site plan that increase required parking by less than five (5) spaces or less than fifty percent (50%), whichever is greater, are exempt from this provision. A citizen participation plan must be approved by the Director, or designee, prior to its execution by the applicant. The Director shall not issue a notice of the application's status pursuant to Section (c) below until after the applicant implements the citizen participation plan and submits to the Director a written report setting forth the results of the citizen participation plan as provided below.

a. All citizen participation plans shall include, at a minimum, the neighborhood civic association in which the development is located or to which it is adjacent. Projects within the central county neighborhoods shall include the Central County Community Advisory Board. A minimum of one (1) meeting shall be held with the affected community.

b. A citizen participation report shall be provided to the Director and include:

1. A written summary of the results of the citizen participation effort prior to the first public meeting in which the application is heard;

2. Dates and locations of all meetings where citizens were invited to discuss the applicant's proposal;

3. The names, dates, addresses, and number of people that participated in the process; and

4. A written summary of the issues and/or concerns raised by residents and how the applicant proposes to resolve these issues and/or concerns. If the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve the issues, the summary should state the reason why these issues cannot be or were not resolved.

(b) _Review responsibilities._ Each review agency shall submit written comments and recommendations to the Urban Planning Division within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after acceptance of the application by the Urban Planning Division. If any reviewing agency report does not respond within said time frame, it shall be presumed that the agency has no comments or objections.

(c) _Reviewing agency reports; comments; required action._ The Urban Planning Division Director shall review the application, the citizen participation report, and the reports of the reviewing agencies.

(1) Within seven (7) days after receiving the reviewing comments and recommendations, the Urban Planning Division shall prepare a report and issue a notice of the status of the application.

a. For a site plan application found to be in compliance or conditionally in compliance, the notice shall state the application complies with the applicable standards and the minimum requirements of this article and that a development order will be granted, inclusive of any applicable conditions identified in the compiled report. The Urban Planning Division Director shall forward the compilation of such reviewing agency reports and the notice to the applicant and the County Commission. Each County Commissioner shall have fourteen (14) days after the date of transmittal of the notification to request that the application be placed on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda. Absent such request, the Urban Planning Division Director shall issue an order consistent with the notice.

b. For a site plan application found not to be in compliance with this article, the notice shall state the reason for noncompliance. The applicant shall have sixty (60) days after the date of the notice to address any noncompliance items identified by the review agencies. The resubmitted plan shall be routed pursuant to Section 39-413(a)(3) and ensuing reviews shall be noticed and processed pursuant to Section 39-413(c). Failure to submit corrections curing deficiencies identified in the notice shall result in issuance of another notice, together with the site plan report, to the applicant and the County Commission stating the intent to deny the site plan application. A County Commissioner shall have fourteen (14) days after the date of transmittal of the notification to request that the application be placed on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda. Absent such request, the Urban Planning Division Director shall issue an order consistent with the notice. Any further request will require a new site plan application submittal and may not be submitted any sooner than six (6) months after the date of the notice of noncompliance.

(2) All site plan applications shall be issued final orders consistent with the most recent notice within one hundred eighty (180) days after the application being deemed complete as set forth in Section 39-413(a)(2) above. The applicant may submit a written request for one (1) extension, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, provided the applicant agrees to waive Section 125.022, Florida Statutes.

(3) Notwithstanding Section 39-413(c), if the Director believes that there is a substantial question regarding the interpretation of this article as it applies to the application, the Director may place the matter on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda for consideration within one hundred eighty (180) days after the application was deemed complete, as set forth in Section 39-413(a)(1) above. If the application generates significant public interest, the Director may place the matter on the County Commission quasi-judicial agenda for consideration within one hundred eighty (180) days after the application was deemed complete, as set forth in Section 39-413(a)(1) above.

(d) _Amendments; revised/changed site plan._ Revisions to development plans after issuance of a site plan approval/development order shall require the applicant to file an application with the Director.

(1) New site plan requests shall be deemed a new application and the procedures of this article shall be repeated with required time limitations beginning anew.

a. Any reduction in the approved setbacks;

b. One (1) or more new buildings, structures, or additions;

c. Deletion of one (1) or more buildings or structures;

d. Relocation of one (1) or more principal buildings or structures by more than ten percent (10%) from the location shown on the approved site plan;

j. Any increase in height of one (1) or more principal buildings or structures.

Significant revisions to a site plan application that deviate from the approved plan shall be documented in the "Justification Statement" of the application.

(3) _Minor deviations from an approved site plan may be approved by the Director._ Minor deviations shall be considered modifications that do not qualify for Section (2) above. Minor deviations may also include, but are not limited to, parking lot revisions that do not significantly alter the internal on-site circulation or alter approved landscaped areas; minor architectural elevation changes and upgrades; dumpster enclosure revisions; generators; minor substitutions to landscaping, provided that the changes reflect an upgrading to the original approved plan; and engineering revisions (drainage, water, sewer, etc.) of a technical nature that do not impact any other aspects of the approved plans. Minor revisions to a site plan application that deviate from the approved plan shall be documented in the "Justification Statement" of the application.

(e) _Effective period of site plan approval._ A site plan approval shall expire within one (1) year if a building permit for the identified improvements is not issued, or if an issued building permit expires and is not in effect for a period of ninety (90) days. In such cases, the development order granting approval shall be null and void.

(f) Whenever the Urban Planning Division Director has denied a site plan application or condition thereto, the Director shall not accept the same or substantially similar request unless the Director determines that such action is permitted due to changed circumstances; to prevent an injustice; or to facilitate the proper development of the County based upon evidence provided by the applicant.
