### ARTICLE XIII. CONVERSION TO CONDOMINIUM AND COOPERATIVE
# 1

# Sec. 5-299. Findings and purpose.

The Board of County Commissioners of Broward County, Florida, finds and determines that there presently exists in Broward County a severe shortage of available rental units resulting in a vacancy rate of three (3) per cent or less. This severe housing shortage has caused a housing emergency so grave that it constitutes a serious menace to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Broward County. Many persons are suffering hardships by finding it difficult or impossible to obtain rental housing, and conversions to condominium and cooperatives are aggravating an already severe problem. By providing tenants of apartments being converted with additional time, by means of lease extensions as provided by law, to examine the housing market, evaluate available housing alternatives, and relocate if necessary, the acute housing problem in Broward County will be less seriously aggravated.

(Ord. No. 80-44, § 1, 7-16-80)

(a) The lease/rental agreement extension period of Subsection 718.606(1)(a), Florida Statutes, as amended, is extended for an additional ninety (90) days, from two hundred seventy (270) days to three hundred sixty (360) days; however, if the lease/rental agreement expires more than two hundred seventy (270) days after the date of the written notice of intended conversion, the tenant may not unilaterally extend the lease/rental agreement.

(b) The lease/rental agreement extension period of Subsection 718.606(1)(b), Florida Statutes, as amended, is extended for an additional ninety (90) days, from one hundred eighty (180) days to two hundred seventy (270) days; however, if the lease/rental agreement expires more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the written notice of intended conversion, the tenant may not unilaterally extend the lease/rental agreement.

# Sec. 5-530. Declaration of legislative intent and purpose.

(a) It is hereby declared that the protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of cultural resources and properties and structures of historical, archaeological, and architectural merit in the County constitute a public policy of Broward County and in the interest of the County's future prosperity and the economic, educational, and general welfare of the residents of Broward County and of the public generally. It is further declared that the preservation of lands containing historical and archaeological sites during a development application process, until completion of that process, constitutes a minimal development control and furthers the health, safety, and welfare of Broward County, by preventing disturbance of valuable community prehistoric and historical sites during the application process, and by allowing governmental and private land planning activities to provide for appropriate incorporation of historic resource sites, archaeological zones, and sites containing archaeological materials into development plans. It is further declared that this public policy is intended to:

(1) Effectuate and accomplish the protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of buildings, structures, improvements, archaeological resources, landscape features, and architectural resources of sites and districts which represent distinctive elements of the County's cultural, social, economic, political, scientific, religious, prehistoric, and architectural history.

(2) Safeguard the County's historical, cultural, archaeological, and architectural heritage as embodied and reflected in such individual structures, sites, and districts and to protect such structures, sites, and districts in order to maintain physical evidence of the County's heritage.

(3) Foster civic pride in the accomplishments of the past.

(4) Protect and enhance the County's attraction to visitors and to support and stimulate the economy thereby.

(5) Promote the use of individual structures, sites, and districts for the education, pleasure, and welfare of the residents of and visitors to Broward County.

(b) In order to implement and give effect to this public policy, the Broward County Historic Preservation Board shall have the authority to make recommendations to the County Commission on historic resource designations; approve, approve with conditions, or deny certificates of appropriateness; review appeals to determinations for certificates to dig; and carry out any other duties assigned to it by the County Commission.

(c) This article shall be effective countywide except in any municipality that is designated as a Certified Local Government (CLG) and has an ordinance that preserves historical sites and structures and that prohibits ground disturbance of archaeological historic resources. Any municipality that has enacted a local historic resource ordinance prior to November 15, 2019, but that is not designated as a CLG shall have two (2) years from such date to obtain CLG status. In the event a municipality with a local historic resource ordinance does not obtain CLG status within the two (2) years set forth in this subsection, this Ordinance shall control in said municipality. If a municipality has obtained CLG status, the municipal ordinance shall control the historical sites and structures, and archaeological sites, within the municipality, provided the municipality has adopted an ordinance protecting historic resources and archaeological sites, and this County Ordinance shall not be applicable within the municipality. If a municipal ordinance does not contain provisions prohibiting ground disturbance of archaeological historic resources but does contain provisions preserving historical sites and structures, this County Ordinance shall be applicable within the municipality with regard to archaeological historic resources. Nothing in this article shall limit any municipality from placing further restrictions or additional requirements on any of the subjects covered by this article.

(d) The Historic Preservation Board is the successor agency to the Broward County Historical Commission with all authorities and duties prescribed in this article, excluding those authorities and duties otherwise assigned. To achieve the goal of effective historic preservation in Broward County, the Historic Preservation Board will guide the development of Broward County's CLG preservation program and may assist any municipalities that request assistance in developing a local CLG application and program.

(a) The following criteria shall be used to determine eligibility for designation of an individual historic resource or a historic district:

(1) Any site, building, structure, object, or district that is listed in the National Register of Historic Places may be designated.

(2) A site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district that is not listed in the National Register of Historic Places may be designated only if it conveys an overall sense of past time and place by possessing at least three (3) of the following attributes of integrity: location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, and association, and is characterized by one (1) or more of the following:

a. Events associated with the site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district have made a significant contribution to the cultural, social, political, economic, scientific, religious, prehistoric, paleontological, or architectural history and have contributed to the pattern of history in the community, Broward County, South Florida, the State of Florida, or the nation; or

b. The site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district is associated with the lives of persons significant in local, state, or national history; or

c. The site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; represents the work of a master builder, architect, or designer; possesses high artistic values; or represents a significant and distinguishable entity, the components of which may lack individual distinction; or

d. The site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history; or

e. The site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district has achieved significance within the last fifty (50) years as a result of the extraordinary importance of an event that occurred at the site on a local, state, or national level; the uniqueness or singularity of the resource; the community's strong associative attachment to the resource; or the significance of a building's association with a renowned architect, engineer, or builder; or

f. The archaeological site is located within an archaeological zone, the site has been previously recorded with the FMSF, and the County has made a good-faith effort to obtain access to the property to conduct a reconnaissance-level archaeological survey, but access to the property has been denied.

(3) Interior spaces shall not be designated unless the interiors have exceptional architectural, artistic, or historic importance, and are customarily open to the public.

(4) A resource must be at least fifty (50) years of age or, if less than fifty (50) years old, must possess exceptional importance.

(b) The following procedures shall be used in determining eligibility of an individual historic resource or a historic district:

(1) A site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district may be requested for designation using a historic designation application form, available from the HPO, and shall be completed by the applicant and returned to the HPO.

(2) An owner of a property, site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district, the County Commission, a municipality, the HPO, or the Historic Preservation Board, upon its own motion, may make application to the Historic Preservation Board for consideration of a property, site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district as a historic resource.

(3) Historic designation applications must contain the legal description of the historic site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district requested for designation, and evidence regarding the ownership of the property. The boundaries of the historic designation site shall be established as follows:

a. For designation of an individual historic resource, the boundary shall be the original site as it was associated with the nominated historic resource during its period of significance. If a portion of the original site containing the historic resource has been sold or developed, that portion of the site that is currently associated with the historic resource shall constitute the boundary.

b. For a historic district, the boundary shall be the geographic perimeter of the grouping of sites and properties included in the district or the original historical subdivision or historical development boundary area, or a portion thereof.

(4) Upon receipt of an application for designation, the HPO shall review the application and supporting documentation for completeness and accuracy. Once determined complete and accurate by the HPO, the HPO shall provide notice to the municipality where the property is located and request a letter of no objection for the proposal before the application proceeds. The municipality shall have thirty (30) calendar days to respond to the notice. Any objection received from the municipality shall be included with the application presented before the Historic Preservation Board and the County Commission. If the application was submitted by anyone other than the owner of record, the HPO shall also send notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner of record that an application for designation has been filed with the County and attempt to obtain the owner of record's written consent to the designation. The application shall be placed on the agenda of the next available, regularly scheduled meeting of the Historic Preservation Board. At that meeting, the Historic Preservation Board will conduct a public hearing and make a determination of eligibility for historic designation and whether to recommend to the County Commission approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the nomination or, if necessary, make the determination whether to recommend designation at a subsequent date.

(5) The designation of the site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district as a historic resource shall not exceed the scope of the actual application for, or the extent of notice of public hearing on, the site, building, structure, object, landscape feature, or district nominated for designation.

(6) Notice of the Historic Preservation Board's public hearing to consider the application shall be provided by the HPO by placing an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the hearing pursuant to this section. Additionally, the HPO shall mail notice of the Historic Preservation Board's public hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all addresses of the owner that are on record with the Broward County Property Appraiser's Office and the address listed on the application request for designation at least fifteen (15) calendar days in advance of the public hearing. Notice of the Historic Preservation Board's public hearing shall be mailed, certified mail, return receipt requested, to the local government within whose jurisdiction the nominated site is located at least fifteen (15) calendar days in advance of the public hearing.

(7) The Historic Preservation Board shall act upon the application within sixty-five (65) calendar days after the date of the meeting at which the application is first considered. In the event the Historic Preservation Board does not act upon the application within the sixty-five (65) calendar days, the application shall be deemed to be denied without prejudice, so as to permit the applicant to file a subsequent application. A written recommendation shall be forwarded to the County Commission for approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the nomination, based upon the evidence presented at a public hearing before the County Commission.

(8) Notice of the County Commission public hearing to consider the nomination shall be provided by the County Administrator by placing an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the public hearing. Additionally, the owner of the nominated property, or the owner's authorized agent, as indicated on the Broward County tax roll, unless staff is presented evidence of a different owner, and the local government within which the nominated property is located, will be mailed notice by the HPO at least fifteen (15) calendar days in advance of the public hearing. Such notice shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested.

(9) If the property owner of an individual historic resource nomination consents to designation, a simple majority vote of the County Commission shall be required to designate a historic resource. If an individual historic resource designation lacks owner consent, then a majority vote plus one (1) of the County Commission shall be required.

(10) No permits for any demolition, alteration, construction, relocation, land disturbance, or development activities shall be issued once a notice of application is delivered to the property owner until the County Commission acts to approve or deny the nomination, or for six (6) months after delivery of the notice, whichever shall first occur.

(11) Appeals of a decision of the County Commission regarding the designation or failure to designate a nominated property as a historic resource shall be by appropriate action pursuant to the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.

(12) Whenever an application or nomination for designation has been denied, the HPO shall not accept the same or substantially the same application for designation for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the denial. The above time limit may be waived by the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission by an affirmative vote of a majority of individuals on the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission when the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission, as applicable, deems, based upon evidence provided by the applicant, such action necessary due to changed circumstances, to prevent an injustice, or to facilitate the proper development of the County.

(4) Ordinary repairs and maintenance to a building or structure that are otherwise permitted by law may be undertaken without a COA, provided the work on a historic resource does not alter the exterior architectural appearance or features of the exterior or designated interior, or alter elements significant to its architectural, archaeological, or historic integrity.

(5) If a COA for relocation is approved, the historic resource shall remain designated during and after its relocation. After relocation, the historic resource site designation shall be amended to reflect the new site location.

(6) Except as set forth in this article, no building permit shall be issued by any building official of the municipal government having jurisdiction or by Broward County that affects any historic resource without an authorized COA.

(b) _Application procedures for a COA:_

(1) The property owner or agent shall complete and file an application with the HPO on a form provided by the Historic Preservation Board.

a. Applications shall be accompanied by drawings, plans, or specifications of sufficient detail to show the proposed exterior or designated interior alterations, additions, changes, or new construction as are reasonably required for decisions to be made by the Historic Preservation Board and the Broward County Environmental Protection and Growth Management Department.

b. Such drawings, plans, or specifications shall include as built or original drawings of exterior elevations, floor plans, site plans, and any other information related to the original architectural design. Project information, including proposed materials, textures, and colors, and all improvements such as walls, walks, terraces, plantings, accessory buildings, signs, lights, and other appurtenant elements, shall be provided.

c. A preapplication meeting between the applicant and HPO is recommended prior to application submittal so that a preliminary assessment of the project's compliance with standards and suggestions for modifications can be made.

(c) _Public meetings for COAs:_

(1) The Historic Preservation Board shall schedule a quasi-judicial public hearing on each application for a COA within forty-five (45) calendar days after receipt of a completed application. The HPO shall determine when an application is complete and provide a staff analysis and review to the Historic Preservation Board. No hearing shall be scheduled sooner than fifteen (15) calendar days after mailing the applicant notice of the hearing. Within sixty-five (65) calendar days after the hearing, the Historic Preservation Board shall issue an order based on the criteria outlined in this section. The Historic Preservation Board's hearing may be continued with good cause shown, supported on the record, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days. If the Historic Preservation Board fails to issue an order on an application within the specified time period, the application shall be deemed denied. The Historic Preservation Board shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove each application based on the criteria contained in this article. In the event an applicant has alleged that strict enforcement of the provision of this article would result in the deprivation of all reasonable economically beneficial use of such property, the Historic Preservation Board shall hear evidence pertaining to the allegation simultaneously with the quasi-judicial hearing for the issuance of the COA.

(2) Appeals of the denial or the approval with conditions of a COA, where the applicant has alleged that the enforcement of the provisions of the article would result in the deprivation of all reasonable economically beneficial use of such property, shall be heard by the County Commission. The hearing shall be noticed and heard in accordance with the provisions of this article regarding other quasi-judicial hearings before the County Commission. All other appeals of a decision of the Historic Preservation Board with regard to the issuance of a COA shall be by writ of certiorari to the circuit court pursuant to the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, within thirty (30) calendar days after the rendition of the Historic Preservation Board's order.

(d) _General criteria and guidelines for granting COAs:_ In approving or denying applications for a COA for alterations, new construction, relocation, demolition, land disturbance, or development activity, the Historic Preservation Board shall use the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for evaluation of the project's compliance and consider the following general criteria:

(1) Whether the proposed modification has a material effect on the historic resource.

(2) Whether the proposed modification will affect the historic and architectural significance, architectural style, design, arrangements, texture, materials, and color of the historic resource.

(5) Appurtenances of a building or structure, such as walls, wrought iron fences, landscaping, or building facades are visually compatible with the building or structure to which they are visually related.

(6) Additions to historic resources are sited as inconspicuously as reasonably possible and, with the exception of waterfront properties, towards the rear. All additions shall be designed to complement the historic resource in terms of scale, shape, and materials, while at the same time being readable as differentiated from and compatible with the old work.

(g) _Additional requirements relating to request to relocate a historic resource:_ In approving or denying applications for a COA for relocation of a historic resource, the Historic Preservation Board, in addition to the general criteria listed in Subsection (d) above, shall consider the following:

(1) Whether the relocation will affect the contribution the building or structure makes to its present setting.

(2) Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated.

(3) Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity.

(4) Whether the building or structure is compatible with the building or structure on its proposed site or adjacent properties.

f. Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding properties;

g. Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the historic resource; and

h. Whether failure to issue the COA for demolition will deprive the owner of all reasonably economically beneficial use of the owner's property.

(2) In addition to the items listed in Subsection (b)(1) above, the applicant shall provide the following information to the Historic Preservation Board:

a. Name of owner of record.

b. Site plan showing all buildings and structures located on the property.

(4) In considering an application for a COA for demolition of a historic resource, the Historic Preservation Board shall consider any evidence, reports, or testimony as to whether the criteria have been met. Unless postponed, as set forth below, the Historic Preservation Board shall render a decision either to deny, approve with conditions, or approve the application for demolition within forty-five (45) days after the public hearing. If the Historic Preservation Board fails to issue an order on an application within the specified time period, the application shall be deemed approved. For decisions of the Historic Preservation Board for approval and approval with conditions, the Historic Preservation Board may require a postponement of the request for demolition for a period not to exceed six (6) months in order that the Historic Preservation Board may ascertain what the local government having jurisdiction may do to preserve the building or structure, and shall make a recommendation to that effect to such local government.

(5) If an application for demolition of a COA for a historic resource is filed, the approval of the COA for demolition shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any other County permits for a historic resource. However, the issuance of a COA for a demolition shall not occur until all other approvals required for the redevelopment of the subject site by Broward County, and any other jurisdiction, are issued. If no approvals are required for the redevelopment, the issuance of a COA for a demolition shall not occur until the preliminary permit is issued by Broward County, and any other jurisdiction, for any ground disturbance for the redevelopment of the subject site.

(i) _Application for economic hardship exception:_ Where, by reason of particular site conditions and restraints, or because of unusual circumstances applicable solely to a particular historic resource or site upon which a resource is located, strict enforcement of the provisions of this article would result in the deprivation of all reasonable economically beneficial use of the historic resource or site upon which the resource is located, the Historic Preservation Board shall vary or modify adherence to this article; provided always that its decision shall ensure harmony with the general purposes of this article and will not adversely affect Broward County. In any instance where there is a claim of undue economic hardship, the applicant shall submit, by affidavit, to the Historic Preservation Board at least fifteen (15) days prior to the quasi-judicial public hearing, the following information:

(1) Amount paid for the property, date of purchase, the description of the entire property purchased, and party from whom the property was purchased, including a description of the relationship, whether business or familial, if any, between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased.

(7) The Historic Preservation Board may further require that an applicant furnish such additional information as relevant to its determination of undue economic hardship. The owner shall permit access to the subject property for the purpose of inspections and appraisals required by the Historic Preservation Board or the HPO.

In the event an applicant has alleged that strict enforcement of the provisions of this article would result in the deprivation of all reasonable economically beneficial use to the applicant, evidence pertaining to this allegation shall be provided before or at the quasi-judicial hearing for the issuance of the COA as set forth in this article. All interested persons shall be allowed to participate in the hearing.

(j) All alterations or repairs shall be performed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the COA.

(k) It shall be the responsibility of the appropriate building official and the HPO to inspect from time to time any work being performed in their respective jurisdictions to ensure compliance with a COA. In the event work is not being performed in accordance with the COA, the building official shall issue a stop work order until it is demonstrated that work will commence consistent with the COA or, if necessary, that an amended COA has been obtained. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as the stop work order remains in effect.

(l) Whenever the Historic Preservation Board has taken action to deny a request for a COA, the HPO shall not accept the same or substantially the same request for a COA for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the denial by the Historic Preservation Board. The above time limit may be waived by the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission by an affirmative vote of a majority of individuals on the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission when the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission, as applicable, deems, based upon evidence provided by the applicant, such action necessary due to changed circumstances, to prevent an injustice, or to facilitate the proper development of the County.

(a) _Certificate to Dig (CTD) required:_

(1) Within a designated archaeological or paleontological site or zone, or historic resource site or property containing archaeological or paleontological resources or artifacts, no person shall undertake any of the following actions affecting the site or property, without first obtaining a fully executed CTD from the HPO for:

a. Any new construction, filling, digging, removal of trees, or other activity that may alter or reveal archaeological material or paleontological material; or

b. Any alterations, relocations, new construction, or demolitions when ground disturbance is likely to occur within an archaeological or paleontological site or zone.

(2) A CTD shall be a prerequisite and in addition to any other permits required by law. The issuance of a CTD by the HPO shall not relieve the property owner of the duty to comply with other state and local laws and regulations.

(4) Whether the plans may be reasonably carried out by the applicant;

(5) Whether the plans comply with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards;

(6) Whether the proposed work will have a negative impact on the historic resource upon which such activity is to be done; and

(7) Whether the proposed work will have a negative impact on other historic resources on the site or on other historic resources within its viewshed.

(c) _Application procedures for a CTD_.

(1) The owner or agent shall complete and file an application with the HPO.

b. Within twenty (20) days after the date that the application has been deemed complete, the HPO shall approve the application for a CTD, approve the application with conditions, or deny the application. In the event that no decision has been rendered within twenty (20) days, the application shall be deemed to be approved.

c. The CTD may be made subject to specified conditions, including, but not limited to, those regarding site excavation.

d. The determination of the HPO shall be mailed to the owner or agent by registered mail within seven (7) days after the decision of the HPO.

e.

f. Whenever a request for a CTD has been denied, the HPO shall not accept the same or substantially the same request for a CTD for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the denial. The above time limit may be waived by the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission by an affirmative vote of a majority of individuals on the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission when the Historic Preservation Board or County Commission, as applicable, deems, based upon evidence provided by the applicant, such action necessary due to changed circumstances, to prevent an injustice, or to facilitate the proper development of the County.

1. The request shall be placed on the agenda of the next available, regularly scheduled meeting of the Historic Preservation Board to review the original HPO decision. The Historic Preservation Board may uphold or modify the HPO decision after considering de novo, the application, statement, and evidence presented by the owner or agent, and statements and evidence presented by the HPO.

2. The decision of the Historic Preservation Board shall be mailed to the owner within fourteen (14) days after the date of the meeting.

3. An approved CTD shall contain an effective date, not to exceed sixty (60) days after the decision, at which time the proposed activity may begin, unless the Historic Preservation Board initiates the nomination process for the site in question as a historic resource or historic district. In such a case, all the rules and regulations pertaining to the nomination process for a historic resource shall apply.

(d) All work performed pursuant to the issuance of a CTD shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. It shall be the responsibility of the appropriate building official and the HPO to inspect from time to time any work being performed in their respective jurisdictions to ensure compliance with a CTD. In the event work is not being performed in accordance with the CTD, the building official shall issue a stop work order until it is demonstrated that work will commence consistent with the CTD or, if necessary, that an amended CTD has been obtained. No additional work shall be undertaken as long as the stop work order remains in effect.

(e) To assist in implementing this section, the County shall adopt a map of known archaeological and paleontological sites and conservation areas. Said map shall be kept and maintained in the offices of the HPO and shall be available for public inspection.

c. Submit the survey to the HPO and the local government having jurisdiction, for review and evaluation, and to the Florida Master Site File section of the Florida Division of Historical Resources. If the County Archaeologist prepares the Phase 1 level survey, the survey shall be submitted to the local government having jurisdiction and to the Florida Master Site File section of the Florida Division of Historical Resources for review and evaluation.

(2) If the professional archaeologist or the County Archaeologist determines that the site is not significant, and said determination is verified by the HPO and the County Archaeologist, or in the case of the County Archaeologist, the Florida Master Site File section of the Florida Division of Historical Resources, then development activities may resume immediately. If the HPO fails to respond within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of said survey, the determination of the professional archaeologist that the site is not significant shall be presumed to be valid.

(3) If the site is determined to be significant, within thirty (30) days after the determination of significance of the Phase 1 level survey, the Historic Preservation Board shall initiate preservation of the site by any of the following:

a. Designate the site as a historic resource;

b. Recommend approval of incorporation of the site into a site development plan;

c. Initiate public acquisition of the site;

d. Offer transfer of development rights to the owner or developer, if available;

e. Recommend offering tax incentives to the owner or developer pursuant to F.S. § 193.505; or

f. Allow development activities to proceed under the supervision of a professional archaeologist, at a level of supervision to be determined by the archaeologist, to ensure protection of the site.

(4) If preservation of the site is not feasible, development activities in the immediate area of the discovery shall be delayed for a period of time not to exceed three (3) months after the date of receipt of the Phase 1 level survey. During this three (3) month period, representatives of the State Division of Historical Resources, the Historic Preservation Board, the HPO, or the agents and employees of Broward County shall seek the right of access to the immediate area to survey. A professional archaeologist retained by the owner or developer shall conduct an archaeological salvage excavation of the area within which the discovery was made; provided, however, that development shall resume upon either the completion of such archaeological salvage excavation or the expiration of the three (3) month period, whichever first occurs. If necessary, the three (3) month time period may be extended for an additional three (3) month time period to allow for completion of the survey and archaeological salvage excavation. If access to the site is denied, the CTD shall be denied.

### ARTICLE XIX. SPECIAL MAGISTRATE PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE FLORIDA LAND USE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT

# Sec. 5-571. Legislative intent.

The purpose of this article is to implement the Florida Land Use and Environmental Dispute Resolution Act, Section 70.51, Florida statutes (the "Act"), as amended, including, without limitation, the following:

(a) Establishing procedures for the initiation, conduct, and conclusion of a Special Magistrate process involving a development order or enforcement action by Broward County and all regulating and enforcement boards appointed by the Board of County Commissioners.

(b) Providing a Special Magistrate process that is a speedy, inexpensive, and simple method for property owners and regulators to settle land use and environmental permitting and enforcement disputes. To that end, property owners and regulators should meet face-to-face, in a non-adversarial atmosphere, to resolve disputes without the need for formal representation.

(c) Providing for negotiations assisted by a Special Magistrate, enabling property owners and regulators to exert more control over their dispute, thereby allowing the parties to shape a resolution rather than having one imposed. The Special Magistrate and the parties should exercise maximum flexibility to adapt these procedures to the exigencies of each particular case, consistent with the requirements of State law and due process.

(a) If an acceptable solution is not reached by the parties after the Special Magistrate's attempt at facilitation, the Special Magistrate shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in the Request for Relief, any responses, and any other information produced at the facilitation or testimony sessions, in order to determine whether the action by the County and any other governmental entities is unreasonable or unfairly burdens the real property.

(b) Within fourteen (14) days of the conclusion of the facilitation session(s), the Special Magistrate shall prepare and file with all parties and participants a written recommendation.

The circumstances to be examined in making a determination may include, but are not limited to:

(1) The history of the real property, including when it was purchased, how much was purchased, where it is located, the nature of the title, the composition of the property, and how it was initially used;

(2) The history or development and use of the real property, including what was developed on the property and by whom, if it was subdivided and how and to whom it was sold, whether plats were filed or recorded, and whether infrastructure and other public services or improvements may have been dedicated to the public;

(4) The present nature and extent of the real property, including its natural and altered characteristics;

(5) The reasonable expectations of the Owner at the time of acquisition, or immediately prior to the implementation of the regulation at issue, whichever is later, under the regulations then in effect and under common law;

(6) The public purpose sought to be achieved by the development order or enforcement action, including the nature and magnitude of the problem addressed by the underlying regulations on which the development order or enforcement action is based; whether the development order or enforcement action is necessary to the achievement of the public purpose; and whether there are alternative development orders or enforcement action conditions that would achieve the public purpose and allow for reduced restrictions on the use of the property;

(7) Uses authorized for and restrictions placed on similar property; and

(8) Any other information determined relevant by the Special Magistrate.

(e) If the Special Magistrate finds that the development order at issue, or the development order or enforcement action in combination with the actions or regulations of other governmental entities, is not unreasonable or does not unfairly burden the use of the Owner's property, the Special Magistrate must recommend that the development order or enforcement action remain undisturbed and the proceeding shall end, subject to the Owner's retention of all other available remedies.

(f) If the Special Magistrate finds that the development order or enforcement action, or the development order or enforcement action in combination with the actions or regulations of other governmental entities, is unreasonable or unfairly burdens use of the Owner's property, the Special Magistrate, with the Owner's consent to proceed, may recommend one (1) or more alternatives that protect the public interest served by the development order or enforcement action and regulation at issue but allow for reduced restraints on the use of the Owner's real property.

(2) Increases or modifications in the density, intensity, or use of areas of development;
