# Sec. 39-12. District boundaries.

(a) Unless otherwise shown, the district boundaries are as defined in the resolutions and ordinances which zone the various properties in the unincorporated areas of Broward County, or the subdividing or boundary lines of recorded plats, or the extensions thereof. Where the districts designated on maps accompanying and made a part of this code are approximately bounded by expressways, highways, street lines, or alley lines and the expressway, highway, street, or alley is a district boundary line between two (2) or more different zoning districts, the district boundary line shall be the center line of such expressway, highway, street, or alley.

(b) Where, due to the scale or illegibility of the district map, or due to the absence of an expressway, highway, street, alley, or recorded subdividing or boundary line of a recorded plat, there is any uncertainty, contradiction, or conflict as to the intended location of any district boundary, the County Commission shall have the authority and duty of interpreting the intent of said district maps so as to determine and designate the proper location of such district boundary in accordance with the spirit and purpose of this code.

(c) _Water areas._

(1) The water surface and the land under the water surface, of all canals, rivers, waterways, ponds, lakes and other water areas in Broward County not otherwise zoned are hereby placed in the same zoning district as the land which it abuts as shown on the zoning district maps. Where the zoning districts shown on the zoning district maps are different on opposite sides of the water area, then the kind of zoning district on each side shall extend to the center line or midpoint of the water area.

(2) For convenience of mapping and clarity, the zoning of water areas is not shown on the zoning district maps but is determined by the provisions of this section.

(d) _Districting of vacated ways._ Where a street or alley shown on a zoning district map is hereafter officially vacated by replatting or otherwise, the land formerly in such street or alley right-of-way shall be included within the zoning district of adjoining property on either side of said vacated street or alley. In the event such street or alley was a district boundary between two (2) or more different zoning districts, the new district boundary shall be the former center line of such vacated street or alley.

(e) _Railroad rights-of-way_. Where not otherwise indicated on zoning district maps or specified in this code, railroad rights-of-way are hereby placed in the same zoning district as indicated or specified for abutting property; except that where the zoning districts are different on opposite sides of a railroad right-of-way, the railroad right-of-way is hereby placed in the more restrictive district of the two (2) zoning districts abutting the right-of-way.

# Sec. 39-13. Regulation of unzoned property.

# Sec. 39-14. Consistency with the land use plan.

Whenever the permitted uses or district regulations applicable to any zoning district permit some uses that are not permitted by the applicable land use plan designation for the property, the provisions of the land use plan shall operate to prohibit those uses on that property as if such restrictions were fully set forth in this code. Where an existing lawful use of land or a structure is no longer permitted by the applicable land use plan restrictions, such use of land or structures shall be considered nonconforming and subject to article VII, Nonconforming Uses and Structures of this code unless a contrary result is specifically provided for in the land use plan.
