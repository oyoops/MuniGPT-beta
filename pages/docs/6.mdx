(3) That the general purposes of the Code, including Article VIII, will be maintained with the adjusted requirements; and

(4) That the granting of the administrative adjustment would not be injurious to the public health, safety, or welfare.

If the Director determines that the suspension of construction could cause imminent peril to life or property, the Director may permit the construction to continue upon such conditions and limitations, including the furnishing of an appropriate bond, as may be deemed proper under the circumstances.

(i) _Expiration:_ Unless appealed, administrative adjustments which allow the issuance of a permit shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of rendition of such adjustment if:

(1) No zoning permit, certificate of use, or other required license has been issued based upon and incorporating the administrative adjustment; or

All written notifications of the intent to revoke a sign permit shall be in accordance with the provisions of Section 162.12, Florida Statutes, shall state the violation, and shall include the following language:

THE HOLDER OF THIS SIGN PERMIT SHALL HAVE THIRTY (30) DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THIS NOTIFICATION TO REMOVE SUCH SIGN, MAKE THE SIGN CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER 39 OF THE BROWARD COUNTY CODE OF ORDINANCES, OR REQUEST A HEARING, IN WRITING, BEFORE A BROWARD COUNTY HEARING OFFICER.

IF THE SIGN IS NOT REMOVED OR MADE TO CONFORM TO THE ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS AND NO WRITTEN REQUEST FOR A HEARING IS RECEIVED BY THE ZONING OFFICIAL WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS NOTIFICATION, THE PERMIT TO ERECT, CONSTRUCT, INSTALL, OR ALTER A SIGN SHALL BE CONSIDERED REVOKED.

(Ord. No. 2018-15 , § 2, 4-10-18)

# Sec. 39-57. General provisions.

The following regulations apply to all signs authorized under this article:

(a) _Building Code._ The Florida Building Code shall control the construction, inspection, maintenance, and demolition of permanent signs, structures, or flag holders.

(b) _Private signs are not permitted on public property._ No private sign shall be erected, altered, or maintained over or upon any publicly owned property or right-of-way. Signs placed in violation of this provision are a violation of this article and shall be subject to immediate removal by Broward County without notice. The placement of an unlawful sign on public property is transient in nature and is, therefore, irreparable.

(c) _Sign placement._ All signs and sign structures must be erected and attached completely on or within the site or property of the owner(s) or occupant(s) installing the permanent or temporary sign. Signs and sign structures shall not extend into any applicable legal right-of-way. No sign shall be erected, altered, or maintained in such location or position as to present any unfinished side toward adjacent property. Trees, rocks, or other naturally occurring landscape features may not be used to support signs. Unless specifically provided elsewhere in this article, a building that abuts the edge of the building site or parcel may only utilize wall, building, or window signs.

(d) _Freestanding sign setbacks._ Unless otherwise provided in this article, permanent and temporary freestanding signs must be at least five (5) feet from any dedicated right-of-way or recorded road easement and must be at least three (3) feet from any other privately owned property. A freestanding sign within a nonresidentially zoned district must be at least twenty-five (25) feet from any residentially zoned property. Setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the outermost portion of the sign that is closest to the parcel line.

(e) _Legibility of signs._ To reduce the dangers of distracting motorists, signs should be adequately legible under the circumstances in which they are primarily seen. The legibility of signs is related to:

(1) The speed at which they are viewed;

(2) The context and surroundings in which they are seen; and

(3) The design, colors, and contrast of the sign copy and sign face.

(f) _Sign height calculation._

(1) The overall height of a freestanding sign or sign structure is measured from the lowest point of the ground directly below the sign to the highest point of the freestanding sign or sign structure.

(2) Exception: Where a freestanding sign or sign structure is mounted within fifty (50) feet of a roadway that has a higher grade level, as compared to the grade level directly below the freestanding sign or sign structure, then the freestanding sign or sign structure's height will be measured from the roadway grade level to the highest point of the freestanding sign or sign structure.

(g) _Sign area calculation._

(1) Unless otherwise provided herein, the sign area shall be calculated as the area within the smallest regular geometric shape or combination of shapes that encompass all the display elements (letters, numbers, figures, characters, logos, etc.) of the sign, including blank areas between display elements.

(2) Sign cabinets. The area of sign faces enclosed in frames or cabinets is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet.

(3) Double-sided signs. Only one (1) side of a double-sided sign is counted in determining the area of sign faces. Where the two (2) sides are not of equal size, the larger of the two (2) sides is used for the determination of sign area. Wedged signs shall be expressed as the sum of the areas of all the faces.

(4) Awnings and marquees. When graphics are incorporated into an awning, the sign area is determined by computing the area of a standard imaginary geometric shape around the sign copy area or graphics.

(h) _Removal prior to tropical storm or hurricane._ To avoid such signs from becoming projectiles, all permitted temporary signs and signs of a temporary nature that do not require a permit pursuant to this article must be removed by the individual that placed the sign, or the individual's designee, in the event that a tropical storm or hurricane warning has been issued for Broward County.

(i) _Failure to comply._ Failure to comply with the requirements of this article shall be deemed a County ordinance violation and the issuance of a citation or notice to appear by a code enforcement officer shall occur, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8½ of the Broward County Code of Ordinances. The process set forth in Chapter 8½ of the Broward County Code of Ordinances is supplemental to any other method of enforcement of the Code of Ordinances authorized by law.

(Ord. No. 2018-15 , § 2, 4-10-18)

A nonconforming sign or sign structure may be refurbished, reinforced, or repaired, provided that no other structural alterations are made. A nonconforming sign may be removed temporarily to perform sign maintenance, reinforcement, or sign repair; however, permanent signs and sign structures that are otherwise moved, removed, or replaced must be brought into conformance with the current sign regulations. Nonconforming permanent signs and sign structures required to be moved because of public right-of-way improvements may be reestablished. Removable faces or sign panel inserts in a cabinet style sign may also be changed by right, and such change does not constitute a structural alteration nor cause loss of nonconforming status.

(b) _Illegally erected signs._ Signs or sign structures that were never lawfully permitted shall not be determined to be legally nonconforming signs and shall be subject to immediate removal without the benefit of an amortization period. Such nonconforming signs and structures shall be removed immediately upon receipt of notice from the Division.

(c) _Nonconforming temporary signs._ Nonconforming temporary signs must be removed within two (2) months after the effective date of this ordinance.

(d) _Ownership._ Nonconforming sign status is not affected by changes in ownership.
