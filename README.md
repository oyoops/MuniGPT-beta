# MuniGPT

MuniGPT is chatbot LLM for inquiries related to regulations on development, construction, and zoning in Broward County, Florida. This utilizes the [OpenAI Text Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) and the [Broward County Municode](https://library.municode.com/fl/broward_county) library.

At the moment, only Chapters 6 (Construction) and 29 (Land use, Zoning) are included. I'll be adding the rest as soon as I can.

MuniGPT's knowledge cutoff date is May 5, 2023.
